2567	0		However they were unable to locate the safe we apparantly had in our room!
3165	0		Room modern but showing signs of wear  tear - not quality furnishings.
6410	0		Fine dining Restaurants like Benihanna, Golden Dragon ,chinese,, Sergios ,Italian,, as well as Regular eating places like pizzerias, delis, hot dog stands.
2657	0		Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star.
1828	0		We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill.

838	0		The lobby isn't very impressive, and we were a bit worried as we headed up to our room,
7451	0		Breakfast was good, especially the fresh-squeezed OJ.
535	1		They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so.
3047	0		Also enjoyed fitness room and pool on top floor- Step-master while enjoying view of downtown with bay in distance...
5132	0		The only lapse in the otherwise excellent service was at breakfast the following morning.
7153	0		I had to leave immediately after my conference and the concierge arranged for a cab to be there waiting for me so I could make my flight.
2216	1		so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.
1944	0		Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.).
3831	0		Great place to stay

3781	0		All in all, a good value mid range hotel.
5259	0		The service is also very good.
3030	0		The decor is quite masculine - sort of comfortable modern look I suppose
867	0		The only complaint would be the night club down the street which played loud bass pounding music on the weekends.
1776	0		but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings.
4396	0		The parking is exorbitant, but drivers dont really have a choice.
434	0		We, a Scottish couple, decided to visit Berlin for four days and after reading positive reviews regarding the location of the Hilton,
164	0		The rooms are shabby,
1581	0		I asked at the reception if a fan was available so that I could shut the window but this request met with a very hostile "NO,
6317	0		This is somewhat true, but undestand that these people are paying abut $50 dollars per person for only the use of the swimming pool and a few of the other pleasures of the resort.
6802	0		We had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped.
4421	1		I would suggest anything in block 5 and up if you want less noise during those hours.
2250	0		Several of us stayed there
6498	0		When we called the front desk about the noise factor, the day person told us they did not have another suite and the couple next door was checking out.
1878	0		and this was by far the noisiest.
5974	0		Breakfast, although continental was also quite good, particularly coffee which was excellent.
4485	0		The staff were very polite, friendly and couldnt do enough for you.
1649	0		I was told by a counter help that your room is locked in for the 14th floor and two beds.
1571	0		oversight by cleaners perhaps??
3884	0		He was very apologetic and expressed that this had been a problem for a number of guests that day.
2323	0		but it accomodated very well for 4 professional twenty-something girls.
989	0		When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change.
0	0		This hotel was very modern and sleek.
5463	0		The stay was very comfortable and the room [small but ample] clean.
7176	0		The restaurant on property was ok - but did not bill to your room.
2149	0		Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget.
1002	0		Very upset with this hotel.
6286	0		Meals were expensive compared to local eateries.
5762	0		The food I ordered was not the food I recieved and the pizza was less than acceptable.

897	0		We gave up and returned the following day for the remainder of our stay.
4940	0		Nice Hotel I just got back from a conference in San Francisco.
1185	0		but this turned out to be a bottle of German sekt when it arrived.
6962	0		The smell was so strong that we actually brought it back to Boston.
1292	0		Lastly housekeeping came to the rooms as early as 7:30. To solve this problem I put the Do Not Disturb sign up till I left the room in the mornings.
6280	0		So why has staying at the Sofitel caused us to go into print?
2235	0		The MOORE is good for the money, but NOT in summer.
6379	0		Both are a block away.
5578	1		AS A MATTER OF FACT, AVOID ALL SECRETS RESORTS, AS THEY ARE BUILDING WITHIN PLAYA DEL CARMEN, AND HAVE OTHER RESORTS.
102	0		The location is great,
1858	0		The hotel is right at downtown and 5 minutes to really good restaurants
2603	0		and it didn't seem that most folks walking around were very friendly or courteous at all.

5680	0		Great location if you need to be in the center of everything
3299	0		The service was very good, prices for meals and drinks expensive as you would expect - no point in whinging about a $12 martini if your paying hundreds for the room.
3415	0		Expensive though, but it is supposedly the best Chinese restaurant in Japan.
755	0		I was quite pleased with this hotel.
309	0		A frustrating and depressing experience.
4868	0		Ah well, we just kept the light closed and laughed it off
7299	0		The restaurant I liked most offered Thai food, called Pagoda.
2816	1		So, we would recommend this property if you are happy with 3-star hotels or lower.
3890	0		The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read.
7195	0		The staff was also very nice.
3423	0		Our room was not large but nicely decorated and very sunny with a good sized bay window looking out onto Geary Street.

6239	0		Stayed for 6 nites , fortunate to be upgraded to Junior Suite, no isssues with room size ,standard rooms noted as small ?,.
3009	0		Most disturbingly, the room reeked of mildew and the linens seemed old and tired, long overdue for replacement.
2126	0		I don't go to Seattle to sit in my hotel room,
4512	0		They said this problem can normally happen and just sent us to the other hotel with the same owner but was much more far away ,quite not responsible,.
343	0		We ate at both restaurants.
3349	0		Breakfast was typical hotel fare, not especially exciting, but fresh, varied and plentiful.

1983	0		It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members.
4947	0		The housekeeping staff was very thoughtful about when they cleaned the rooms and they did a great job.
4351	0		When we checked in on Tuesday we were told that there would not be any diving available until Saturday, the day we were flying back to the US.
5853	0		For some reason we were given the honeymoon treatment with fresh fruit etc. a lovely surprise.
6294	0		On arrival we were given a map and directions to les rambles, the receptionist also told us which streets close to the hotel to avoid.
6842	0		Bed was very comfortable.
7361	0		There is a 2 hour cocktail hour everyday from 6-8 where you can get free drinks and snacks, while tipping of course, and breakfast is also free and a huge variety of items to choose from.

2463	0		If it turns up, we will call you.
1033	0		rooms were clean  the housekeeping staff were lovely.
1533	0		From then on we used the stairs coming to and from the room
1900	0		My husband smokes, but I do not,
6443	0		This time the lights did not work and the remote control had to be replaced.
252	0		The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room.
5167	0		The location is PERFECT.
6245	0		The rooftop bar ,small, but nice outlet after a long day.
1610	1		If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you.
1545	0		Being on the first floor we could not leave the balcony door or window open as anyone could potentially climb in if they wanted to make an effort.
3565	0		Heart of HollywoodO
3572	0		Though, there are a significant number of places to eat within walking distance.

2145	0		and they were kind enough to take care of them until I returned the next day, ashamed but extremely grateful.
5199	0		The beds are very comfortable and have more pillows than even I can use
7240	0		A buffet is offered in addition to the regular menu.
4242	0		The rooms had an understated elegance to them and there was considerable attention to detail - including a starched linen cloth at the foot of the bed for the slippers - a nice touch indeed.
7295	0		You may wait for your luggage, or for any special requests like a replaced lightbulb.
1377	0		it ruined our holiday in Berlin!!
7527	0		The water is warm but fairly murky....not nearly as nice as the beaches is Cuba but still goregous.

3697	0		The staff was very welcoming and helpful.
2634	0		Saw other guests who were also upset.
935	0		The room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked an overgrown garden with a block of flats looking directly onto the rooms.
6552	0		It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South.
5058	0		Very convienent to everything.
7425	0		Yes, the air conditioning unit is noticeably noisy - I got used to the sound and didnt hear it within minutes, but if you get bothered by this sort of thing its something to note.
2511	0		and then notified me that the emails could not be delivered due to technical difficulties.
6523	0		I had no idea there were so many nurses with a night life in New York

2230	0		- Boeing : 45 min busride, 1 hall with poor pieces, 2 videos, 1 was really poor, busride to the factory.
3338	0		On reflection, a chest of drawers might be a useful addition to Room 515, but in the scale of things, how minor is that?
5834	0		Loved it.
1078	0		I do have to mention the staffs were excellent in all departments of the hotel, Very helpful.

7264	0		The service was a bit slow at the steakhouse, but give them time.

2943	0		I'd definitely stay here again.
1922	0		We liked the in-room refrigerator.
4274	0		This place was just disgusting.
2449	0		Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby.
1511	0		and really did not inspire confidence.
2979	1		Food in over cooked, at least the water in cafe was drinkable, and don't be fooled by there complimentary newspaper, if you read the sticker the put on it you will see that you will be charged for it to $$$$.
6803	0		The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids ,5 and 10, stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once.
4894	0		PoolsThree on site, but one was closed for repairs at the far end of the resort.
4180	0		We also felt very safe.
2392	1		Be careful of the room type if you are more than one person.

5907	0		The breakfasts were some of the best we had throughout our trip.

6248	0		Tinker to improve, yes.
841	0		I had read that the street was a bit noisy,
6249	0		Stay there and enjoy, we did.
6429	0		Nothing wrong with that, however, little has been done to update the facilities to provide for modern conveniences, save for the free high speed wireless internet.
1328	0		It was extremely well insulated against noise;
5555	0		We wanted to make this trip special, fun, and the resort ruined it.
1463	0		Would I stay again?
5783	0		What a major disappointment.

2245	0		I stayed at the Moore for 11 nights whilst on a conference in Seattle.
6333	0		I found that the photos posted on their site are pretty accurate.
6091	1		Also, if you need services find a good front desk clerk, they helped us find a rental car when we were told none were available at all locations we called.
3052	0		This gave us access to a great continental breakfast and evening munchies.
123	0		1. At first we got an unrenovated room.
5738	0		The rooms all have cable TV and theres free internet access in the lobby.
6069	0		We enjoyed our stay, but we always make the best of a situation.
2831	0		Which doesn't make sense.
4230	1		If you go to Salem, take the Trolley Tour.
1620	0		All in all a OK hotel, but not nice and cosy.
5211	0		I booked the room to have a ocean view room, the first room did have a view but mostly of the hotel across the street.
7162	0		We had a very large and pleasant room on the 1st floor with a kitchen in a cupboard, a table for 2, a nice wide bed and a bathroom with lots of towels.
5318	0		When complaints were put in about this absolutly nothing was done
3789	0		The drinks and the view at the bar on the roof are great, but the sushi was average.
18	0		Too much attention on 'fabulousness' throughout the hotel (the public spaces are sleek and unwelcoming) and not enough on basic guest comfort.
6272	0		I was a late arrival to hotel.
6152	0		Heavenly is right
2267	1		My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!
501	0		A huge decorated Cristmas tree and poinsettias in the lobby was enhanced by the deep red walls and wallpaper and crystal chandeliers.
7286	0		Housekeeping was quick to make up the room each day that I was there and were very friendly when I saw them in the halls.
2896	0		more like a bitter sip of bad coffee at the end of a great meal.

5842	0		get to the pool early to reserve a spot

418	0		Stayed here for four nights.
1884	0		The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations, transportation, directions, etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant
4702	0		The bathroom was amazing.
2105	1		and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.
3060	0		I lived in Center City Philadelphia for 10 years and was still shocked by the number of homeless people in Seattle.
1234	0		Hackescher Market with it's bars and restaurants is only an 5 minute walk away.
3366	0		The following day my office tried to call and was told that we werent staying there.
5760	0		Not exactly my idea of exclusive service and definitely not mentioned during booking or in the brochure.
534	1		it is better to avoid the bar.
3533	0		For visiting sites in other areas of the city ,we loved visiting Frido Kahlos Blue House in Coyoacan,, the hotel will arrange for taxi service.
5134	0		I was hungry for a bit more than that and ordered eggs and sausage.
5107	1		However, be prepared that most restaurants and hotels are working at half of their usual staff since Katrina.
2647	0		However, when we got there,
216	0		But the rest of the hotel, forget about it.
2811	0		It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with
4010	0		They carried themselves with dignity and were appreciative of tips-while not acting as though they expected to be tipped.
2339	0		you'll have an ok time if you're just expecting a basic place to sleep.
5772	0		This review could go on forever so I will condense.
7241	0		Portions were huge and Im not sure any of us were able to finish.
5535	0		And to find this fact out, we spoke with 4 different people.
3536	0		Check in on a Thursday evening was rapid we chose this hotel on kowloon side as we were there for business.

917	0		Polite staff.
748	0		The pool was mid-seized but adequate and clean.
5972	0		All reception staff were great and more than ready to answer any questions we might have had.
320	0		So keep this in mind if you choose to stay here: if, as you look for your room,
6080	0		The pool was small and most always very crowded.
6871	0		The pool which goes up and down the length of the resort is so big that at times you feel like it is your own pool.
5390	0		Rooms are small, but perfect for what a busy or active traveler needs.
1337	0		The bathroom was very stylish in appereance, but at closer look,
7257	0		Yes, you must overlook some of the workmanship, but the hotel is beautiful, the pool was awesome and the beach is spectacular.
2120	0		but you can't beat the location!

2989	0		The room decor is very comfortable
490	0		The 6th floor however, is NOT non-smoking;
4553	0		Nobody knew whats in the chafing dishes or on all the plate, because no labelling.
4595	0		Only compaints are that the service is a little slow during busy times and during one of my stays there were three or four tiny ants on the floor.
6734	0		The shower incidentally was vibrating fine :-,
5533	0		the resort makes it diffficult to attain and book such reservations.
1493	0		I have written a previous review on the Alsterhof and having stayed there again,
1064	0		Had the pleasure of visiting Berlin for a city break in September.

6136	0		After three weeks travelling in CA and staying in all types of accommodation ,5 star, BBs etc, The Chancellor is one of the nicest places we have stayed.

2195	0		We took our dead bed bugs downstairs and spoke with Mike (the manager).
292	0		This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair.

2276	0		and I have always found the bathrooms to be in impeccable condition
272	0		Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.
1621	0		after booking thru expedia, i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick.
6686	0		The building was characteristically New Orleans and made me feel like I was staying with family or friends rather than at a hotel.
5606	0		The beach is too small, but what beach isnt in Waikiki.
2599	0		and Public Transportation system were not running at full capacity.
2885	0		Would I stay there again -- Maybe.

7027	0		Enjoy.
2883	0		and she credited $75 against my hotel bill.
5616	0		Getting there by taxi can be a small problem first time but the hotel gives you a map so after the first time, there are no problems.
1248	0		Thus in order to take a ride in the elevator up through the middle of the huge cylindrical aquarium you must pay an entrance fee to the Aqua Dom which is expensive.
604	0		but there were some tourists like us as well.
4226	0		It is the only 2-day tour you can get on and off the trolley at the different stops.
6851	0		A complete steal.

4801	0		Also, i stayed for 4 nights and the breakfast kind of gets repititive after 2 days.
5171	0		The lounge area overlooking the Arno was a great place to relax at the end of the day and get a few glasses of wine before heading out for dinner.
6060	0		We got a great rate that was advertised on Travelzoo.com
3244	0		The room we had was perfect.
1212	0		I did just that,
3770	1		And, if you are not wealthy, you should visit the cafe anyway.
1351	0		We were transferred to another hotel having been told that there has been an issue with their computer (and that 25 other people were also affected).
5372	0		Many thanks to the General Manager, Allen Kramme, for his note of welcome and the fruits and water on arrival.
5805	1		They offer handicapped accessible rooms which are more spacious and located at the enterior of the hotel ,which I would recommend as those staying with rooms facing the streets often complain of the noise,.
2155	0		The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one
6756	0		The Best in NYC:
3996	0		The weather was really tropical and sunny.
3238	0		The free internet was a godsend.
6315	0		As I said I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to relax, be totally pampered, and enjoy some of the benefits of the good life.
2122	0		the front desk service can be loveable, rude or hard to understand; and the water pressure isn't the greatest.
6740	0		Yes indeed
2757	0		Beds are comfy.
6738	0		When I arrived the first night, it was just in time for their nightly wine happy hour.
5596	0		I would never stay at this hotel again.
1960	0		and it shocks me...
2936	0		Booked Sheraton for one night through hotwire as I extended my stay in Seattle
4263	0		Great massage
4066	1		I think the pitfalls I discuss below could be avoided if you know what youre up against from the outset.
3584	0		My room was number 9 and was really quiet.
1415	0		but very nice fellow who acted as doorman during the day.
4130	0		I did not like the red or white wines.
2963	0		and I had to check 4 times before it was available.
5429	1		There are some cons about this hotel - REMEMBER - if you drive down your parking is NOT FREE
5693	0		The other bad reviews must have gotten older rooms before they were renovated.
4032	0		Not professional management
4107	0		We were not able to upgrade , we arrived at 8:30pm, and they said that all the upgrade rooms were booked, but in my opinion the regular booking suffised.
868	0		We loved the location of the hotel and would stay there again!
4379	0		We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days.
3269	0		From the time you walk in the door, this hotel makes you feel welcome.
6511	0		In fact I could care less.
3546	0		The rooms are fresh, crisp, well maintained, bathrooms are spacious enough and the open bathroom is easily rectified by simply drawing the blinds.
306	0		but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area).
1844	0		It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent.
5954	0		Hotwire should be embarrassed go carry this hotel.
5816	0		It was also in a great location for all the hot Manhattan Night Clubs.
4035	0		Because of the large amounts of water, my room flooded, as did many others.
4288	0		They have nice meeting room space, and the rooms are reasonably priced.
3282	0		Beautiful Stay Wonderful hotel, excellent location
2324	0		The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, had a huge walk-in closet (doubles for a small bedroom, haha) and extremely affordable.
1965	0		I requested a bottle opener
391	0		The size of the room was adequate
5607	0		The location, however, cant be beat.
3257	0		We were very cautious because we were taking our two year old daughter and wanted to ensure that it was suitable.
6492	1		Do not take the Raymond Hudd suite unless you take both of them
4063	0		very clean, incredible beach, ample bars and watering holes all around the campus, excellent athletic facilities, and again cannot overemphasize the friendly staff.
2997	0		and the hotel is in a great area of town.
5497	0		The bathrooms were larger than expected and the walk-in shower was wonderful.
3481	0		We left a detailed message the following morning but received no response that day and the following day was her day off.
1438	0		Cost 5euro.
734	0		As stated in other reviews, the location is on the (slightly tourist) bus line 200 and a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, and 10 minutes to the Zoo Garten Train station.
3940	0		The concierge was very informative and the front staff very polite.
5000	0		Overall, we had a great time.
1287	0		but it was two twins put together.
6979	0		This appeals to me but might not be everyones taste.
504	0		Complimentary bottles of water and chocolates daily was good
6863	0		My sister who is a picky eater found the food to be good.
2654	0		I understand that these are luxury services
2619	1		Park across the street, $6 for 24hrs on weekends, $35+ at the hotel.
3881	0		Hmmm, basic info a concierge should know.
6545	0		However, there is a lovely lounge just off the chic lobby where a hearty Continental style breakfast is served every morning ,included in room rate,.
5428	0		Just about 3 blocks or so from the French Quarter and directly across the street from Harrahs Casino.
3757	0		We swam out to island about 100 yds off shore only to realize that current on way in was very strong.
677	0		The room was ok
4744	0		Decided at 1am one night to visit Paris for a couple of days, searched and booked 10hrs later through boookings, finding a room ready and just sufficient to sleep a family of 4 with 2 children under 5 a few hours later.
338	0		The lobby is beautiful.
183	0		Had been warned of a noiseless facelift but was unprepared to battle my way through a foyer of painters
1079	1		I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality
7151	0		The location, as already mentioned, is great because of all the shops and restaurants within a few blocks.
6024	0		In addition, when we met up with our friends and they helped us unload our luggage, the lady from the front desk ran out and confronted us about having extra people.
626	0		We travelled back to london on a Saturday evening.
5077	0		Took a room on the fourth floor, room was nice and clean, laminate floors throughout and a wonderfully powerful shower, plasma TV
1324	0		and it turned out they had apparently forgot to forward our reservation internally.
3829	1		If I was to give one tip then take a taxi from the airport - we got the train and then the metro but had to make few changes along the way.
1348	0		good hotel located at alexander platz like 15 minutes by taxi to shopping areasclean midsize room ,mine was a single with little strange configuration in the hotel corner everything correct hotel with modern decorgood breakfast buffet included in rateperfect for business with a lot of restaurants around go for the italian left hand size of square coming from the hotel
1307	0		On the third day our key would not work
4544	0		We called to the front desk and got promised they will change it, nothing was happen during our stay.
1205	0		Easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and historic sights.
1980	0		The staff, however, left more to be desired.
5789	0		great hotel 14 of us stayed here for a hen weekend our stay was almost faultless.
1709	0		The hotel had responded that, that wouldn't be a problem.
6923	0		The CD cube bedside clock/alarm, the metal mesh chairs and the cute one cup at a time fast coffee brewer all met with her approval.
7444	0		Our rate included breakfast ,2 people,.
7335	0		We called and a sheet was dropped off for us to make our bed, as there was no housekeeping staff available.
1036	0		The Reception staff were aloof  sometimes quite rude.
7518	0		The second day, we walked to the metro station ,about 10 minutes, and took the metro to Central Station, which took about 30 minutes.
2507	0		Two personal items of mine were taken from my room and again,
1544	0		and still had traces of what used to shield the balcony along the side so could be quite dangerous as these are very sharp.
6376	0		Still, it was a great value and the location cant be beat.
2480	0		The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost.
452	0		We found it worn and noisy.
602	0		It is 5 minutes walk wheeling our bag from Zoo Station, where we came into Berlin from Schoenfeld Airport.
5705	0		We just returned from Vieques.
365	0		They also have a nice pool and spa
4655	0		I had two bathrooms, a dining area, couch, wet bar and there is a Murphy bed in the living room so I suppose it would be great for families, or to sell if the place is sold out.
603	0		The hotel is modern, clean (very) business hotel,
5101	0		My room had a great view of the Ala Wai Canal.
2628	0		It was the worse stay we had ever had at a hotel.
7498	0		These trams do not go in front of hotel.
5858	0		I would thoroughly recommend the hotel.
20	0		The difference was stark.
5741	1		Boston itself is a really easy city to walk around and I would highy recommend it for a short break.
3818	0		So on the way home I was once more reminded of my vacation stay at the Newport Beachside Resort when I had to be embarassed and use my high intrest credit card to pay for dinner.
2693	0		and they had no response.
945	0		and it was either boiling hot or freezing cold.
1618	1		at bar called vang gogh the owner play piano.....try the dada falafel at oranien str, and cafe einstein.
4611	0		He lost everything in the storm.
6808	0		The evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold
3121	0		We asked for robes
2926	0		I booked this hotel on hotwire and got a great price of 107 p/n for a weekend.
5866	0		It goes every 20min to the NH Barbizon ,much more expensive, across the central station ,near the red light district,.
450	0		shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance.
3247	0		It is only a short walk away from the Eiffel tower.
5320	0		Bottom line is I will never return to this resort simply because management did nothing to correct this problem.
1932	0		We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience.
5942	0		From everything that I have heard and read this is not just at the PCP, but at most of the resorts too.
4820	0		If you wanted lobster or shrimp you had to pay an additional $27.00.
5449	0		It is located on the street parallel to the canal right behind the central train station.
3906	0		It was a good choice for placing the lobby, as we didnt have to walk through crowds to get to our room.
3435	0		My husband and I stayed at the Park Hotel and enjoyed our time in Amsterdam.
4571	0		Directions from the hotel website were right on, check-in was completed in 30 seconds for a weekend stay.
5702	0		The restaurant was pretty terrible - the worst nasi goreng I had in 2 weeks by far.
3358	0		The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub and hand-held shower which was a nice touch.
6290	0		It is very difficult to put into words - we have stayed in many Hotels which provide equally as good rooms, clean beds and showers, a pleasant ambiance, friendly staff and are situated in good locations.
7416	0		They charged the wrong girl, this time.
324	0		Our first room was very small, the upholstery and lampshades(!) were stained, the furniture desperately needed to be refinished,
2636	0		State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location.
5756	0		Very nice touch.......until I went into the bathroom and found it infested with ants.
2028	0		Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet.
509	0		Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.
2428	0		It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference.
235	0		It was all white, with no goodies.
3805	0		You book a top floor, you get first floor, you booked a suite, and got a room...you go out to your balcony to relax...and someone from a top floor....,which you reserved, has just spit on the back of your head.
2001	0		Our only complaints concerned the front desk.
1339	0		For one thing, the wash basin was a porcellain bowl placed on a wooden top.
4157	0		Gets noisy in the morning with street cleaners so forget the lie in go to Barneys in Jordaan ,Haarlemerstraaat, for breakfast instead, much more fun ,can I have some more pancakes with extra maple syrup please,.
1930	0		However, we liked the bar quite a bit.
3334	1		Almost forgot, it is even easier to find it when you arrive at Piazza Roma than the website says, and takes less than 10 minutes to walk even with a case.
5786	0		As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful.
6494	0		,There are only 2 of these suites and they take up the entire floor.,
5511	0		What more can you ask for?
6917	0		A cute parrot show along with a horse show was nice but the highlite of the tour was the chance to swim with the dolphins, at the dolphin and sea lion show you have a chance to get a kiss from a very affectionate sea lion a moment you will not soon forget, and they will capture it on film for you, for a nominal fee of course.
3875	0		To the concierge problem...we dealt with three concierges during our stays.
1933	0		There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle,
1779	0		I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.
6153	0		This was our first stay at a Westin, and it was definitely very close to heaven.
1418	0		and it took 12 hours to get a key to it.
2378	0		Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance.
6554	0		Both beaches offer restroom facilities.
1757	0		concierge was helpful.
4900	0		It is definately not a four star.
590	0		The lobby and cocktail bar were a lovely touch and very relaxing.
2401	0		We booked this hotel through priceline at a very low rate.
2561	0		The location is good for touring.
1629	0		They offered to bring an extra cot.
7046	0		The hotel is a five minute walk to the Plaza Espanya metro, but there isnt much in the immediate area in the way of shops, restaurants or tourist attractions.
137	0		He recommended the restaurant Stamhouse which is part of the hotel.
2981	0		Next time We will stay at the Camlin or one of the other real 4 Star hotels in the same area!!!!!!!!
4784	1		So if you want nightlife, you need to drive to it.
4792	0		Well, havent stayed in Four Seasons or Peninsula so hard to compare those clearly spectacular venues.
7391	0		Lack of service and nightlife
6856	0		We went to the Supreme, one of the resorts buffet restaurants.
522	0		Space, cleanliness, large functional bathroom, and new bed made up for the somewhat odd decor of the room.
7532	0		Just a few tips.
6843	0		Service was very nice, and the beach was awesome
4170	0		This is unusual and may be due to size of the rooms but for such a well thought out hotel, I thought this was a significant issue.
6450	0		Half way through someone came over to help since he was looking for a tip.
1390	0		Excellent location - calm yet only a 10 minute walk from the Museeninsel, with the U-Bahn in front of the hotel.
720	0		not is it a good experience.
223	0		but the luxury ends right there.
826	0		The next day that problem already occured at 8!
4578	0		We chose the Laurel Inn because it takes pets and provides parking, but found that it has a lot more going for it.
2202	0		As I pulled down the covers to go to bed I saw another bed bug crawling along the sheets.
29	0		and this is essential as the hotel's proximity to a very still tributary to the Spree means that the area is plagued by large, voracious mosquitoes.
6472	0		Thanks to your reviews, I was able to eliminate some of my potential choices and to pick the Hotel Metro, where we got a family suite with 2 bedrooms- one for Mom Dad, and one for the teen-age girls.
904	0		The service was dreadful.
4233	0		This was very easy and the concierge gave us train times and directions.
4474	0		The location is the best thing about this hotel - only minutes from Circular Quay, close to the Opera House and steps from great restaurants and cafes.
1856	0		Starting from the first minute of our stay, hotel personnel didn`t make us feel like a guest but more like an intruder.
411	0		None of these Hilton entities have had the courtesy of even responding (no less reversing this charge) in over a week.
2047	0		In fact the bathroom showed a bit of wear.
6397	0		Exceeded our expectations
2961	0		My only minor complaint was that it was difficult to access the free internet.

6500	0		,They decided to stay another night.,
2282	0		You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it.
4776	0		Worth area.
3312	0		The walls are covered in cream striped fabric, and there are very beautiful wall lights and table lamps.
1003	0		We had booked as part of a group for three nights from Thursday
3660	0		The animation ,entertainment, crew were terrific.
5797	1		Stay away from this hotel, if you really need to be downtown stay in a well known chain for a few extra bucks, your peace of mind will be worth it.
3747	0		The room we had was small but had enough room for two people ,assuming you arent spending much time in the room,.
1786	0		My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle.
3880	0		He then said we did not need reservations at the third.
2621	0		Stayed in the old tower 10th floor.
7029	0		Loads of choice and well presented.
376	0		we had a corner suite so we had plenty of room,
6027	0		However, only 2 of us stayed at the hotel
2682	0		To top it off they weren't too apologetic.
7523	0		As I read in recent reviews there is difinitely a lang barrier if you do not speak spanish, but there is always someone around that does speak english.
1497	0		When I arrived there was no water for a few hours due to construction work.
6936	0		We will definitely stay here again.
4447	0		The best part of the meal was the appetizers: meats, cheese, and the bread
5825	0		Fabulous Hotel I just got back from an overnight stay at this hotel and
5453	0		I was not disappointed.
1013	0		and not have to change the following day as our friends were due to arrive the next day.
1952	0		This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.
6681	0		Well definitely stay there again :-,
5348	0		So I contacted Hotel Connect ,who we made our booking with - fantastic company, to ask what was happening with our booking, she promptly phoned the hotel, we could hear the conversation as we were sat in the lobby - quite funny really.
6900	0		Even with that knowledge the place is so beautiful and they are so nice, I want to go back as soon as possible.
3259	0		We stayed in a 1 bedroom lake view suit.
485	0		Be prepared that most Berlin hotels do NOT have air conditioning!
2221	0		The desk people were very friendly and helped us in any way.
985	0		The room was extremely basic and the bed
548	0		Overall, I will stay Hotel Savoy again for my next Berlin trip for its location and service.
2513	0		Fifty dollars were added to my bill for items from the mini-bar which I did not order.
5	0		Our first trip to Berlin, so we were unfamiliar with the city layout.
3849	0		Well, we turned on my laptop and Tmobile came up.
378	0		Food _��_ Breakfast _��_ Only had breakfast on the last day _��_ good spread, fresh and presented well.
6044	0		Besides this the room was on the very busy street side and there were roadworks going on during the night.
6246	0		Overall smashing hotel, could it be improved ?
7430	0		I especially want to note the cleaning crew, who took the time to acknowledge us with a pleasant and sincere hello or good morning each time we passed.
4530	0		The price we paid and the service provided us has not been of 5***** Quality and the reason are: Transportation to the hotel was very confusing.
352	0		I would go here if money were of no object (and not otherwise).
3894	0		The concierge was very helpful in booking us a rental car.
538	0		The location is really convenient to use any public transport (400m from Zoo Station)and two blocs away from KUFUDAMM.
6110	0		Rooms were fine - ,some nicer than others,, but all were cleaned every day.
6275	0		resturant was ok.
2305	0		It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom!
126	0		I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed
5466	0		Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US.
1411	0		I had to attend Berlin at rather short notice to attend a large conferenece of lawyers: INTA.
4095	0		We went to Bannigans next door which is adequate for a supper and a beer.
4196	0		We swam with sharks and sting rays.
6904	0		We recently spent 12/9-16 in this resort and if there is a down side to it the only complaint would be that our ceiling fan broke on day 2 and apparently replacement units are hard to come by in the Dominican Republic and so we lived without it for the duration, not in surmountable.
6424	0		Not exactly a gem
487	0		We upgraded directly with the hotel.
4960	0		Great Hotel in Good Location
4	0		Great location in front of a u-bahn stop.
2739	0		and it was my fifth stay in 10 years.
1903	0		We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony,
7345	0		The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top.
2394	0		and the beds took up most of the room.
6105	0		The area was really nice, away from the crazy busy areas.
5668	1		Our Classic room was a bit small and you might consider upgrading to a larger room if you are staying for very long.
4599	0		Noise: Constant ,until 4AM, front desk unapologietic, room on 3rd floor as if on the dancefloor,.
4300	0		Terrible Behaviour, good breakfast
1567	0		It took us 5 mins to actually get into the room via key card as had no idea how to use it (No instructions given at desk!!) First impression of room...
480	0		Excellent fitness room, though I did not use the spa/pool.
3076	0		Give me a break.
2355	0		In the morning we adults had an icecold shower, the kids refused to do so....
4598	0		Service: abysmal ,you are supposed to be assigned a peronal assistant to cater to your every whim...I got a phone number which was always busy and a front desk that could care less,.
1518	0		breakfast was very good.
1236	0		Rooms very large with big bathrooms and a walk-in shower (unusual in European Hotels).
2903	0		If you don't mind paying $70/night (excluding gratuities) for parking go ahead.
999	0		In other words, if you don't mind the comfort of your bed and if you are a smoker, you will love it!
3924	0		He should have been the one to resolve the matter.
6258	0		Staff was helpful and nice, breakfast was adequate, free internet access was a nice treat.
5170	0		It was a great boutique hotel that had the personal feel that I was looking for.
2946	0		and subsequently read some reviews about construction noise so had some concerns.
845	0		though there aren't any parks very close by.
2174	0		so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying.
6737	0		I otherwise probably would not have been able to stay there for four nights ,it isnt cheap,, but with work paying for it, I got to splurge a little.
4119	0		Everyone here seem to enjoy their work and it shows.
6781	0		While it is not a full breakfast buffett, it sure is a nice to have something in your stomach before leaving the hotel.
4928	0		lots of fresh fruit salads and juices plus all the Jamon and olives you can eat.
5315	1		The pools were very clean, but you had to get up at 5am to put your towel on a loung chair or you wouldnt get one by the pool or under an umbrella.
790	0		From 8 o' clock on it was just a banging of doors and throwing things around in the hallway.
1446	0		and the draws for clothes were below the mattress.
1168	0		and the only complaint we have is that the bath towels are very small,
1310	0		while they cleaned the room which they had not bothered to do earlier bacause of the check-in mix-up.
3908	0		By the way - the glass elevators are a nice touch
6037	0		However the best thing about the room was the wonderful view of the Boston skyline.
2873	0		After 20 minutes the desk person said, that must have been a duplicate message
4147	0		Anyway, having upgraded to the tower room with two queen beds, we had absolutely no complaints.
2629	0		They were no help to us at all.
5694	0		Ours was perfect.
3087	0		Parking was quite expensive.
4568	0		Wouldnt Hesitate to Return
687	0		Unfortunately I ended up in the latter half!
4624	0		Upon entering, the entire lobby is under construction, so you have to lug your stuff up an escalator to the temporary lobby on the second floor.
5552	0		2 days went by where our room was not even cleaned at all, no new towels, nothing.
6415	0		THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in KoOlina.
6706	0		Our check in was done in the room, we never had to stop by the front desk.
4822	0		For us it was a week in hell.
1615	0		The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.
2095	0		but you only get what you pay for
2470	1		You can catch the monorail a block from the hotel if you want to visit the Seattle Center.
1070	0		We had looked to pay for an upgraded to the executive floor
518	0		Staff gave accurate restaurant and transportation recommendations,
607	0		Bedroom- we had taken a slight upgrade room on the 5th Floor was spacious, well equipped.
3604	0		Take a left when you exit the hotel and there is a wonderful bakery down the next street open early for freash breakfast.
3895	0		The room was very clean and nicely decorated.
1927	0		I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay.
761	0		I needed to print something,
3672	0		Check in was fine.
5152	0		We only had to take a cold shower one day and it gave us a good laugh.
3703	0		The hike to the convention center is not horrible, but longer than I anticipated, especially in long pants at 2:00 in the afternoon.
5166	0		It was fantastic.
1057	0		Lovely hotel.
6690	0		I had no problems getting around by myself.
736	0		This was a decent vantage point and was obviously a safe and quiet neighborhood.
979	0		or brakes come to think of it!!
3751	0		We also had our own patio area where where we could hang wet clothes, snokel gear, etc. ,seperate patio but not secluded from view of other rooms,.
5659	0		While Im certain the service for all guests is exceptional, the extra attentiveness by Anthony, the Club Concierge was most welcome, especially from our daughter.
445	0		Breakfast choice was great,
2826	0		The rate fluctuated with each phone call and I made 3 of them.
4745	0		Even though the initial request for extra bedding wasnt made very clearly we were accommodated and looked after properly.
6770	0		There was also a small bar area with a minibar underneath.
7181	0		Everything looks sharp and the hotel is well-run.
2712	0		The big message from the front desk is that they are too busy and don't care.
4311	1		If you receive this, please note: It is NOT APPLICABLE to Sarentos , roof-top-expensive-incredible views, Restaurant.
5268	0		There is also jet skiing, snorkeling, etc.
172	0		Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean!
912	0		Nice hotel with good location near the shopping area, subway station, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church etc. Rooms are quite small, but clean and modern.
4740	1		make sure you have plenty of $1 bills or 50/100 peso notes the really do deserve their tips.
475	0		Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out.
5966	0		We finally got someone to come turn it off about 2:30 AM.
900	0		Breakfast was always busy.
1656	0		I only regret that I didn't wear my new Trip adviser bill hat!
4346	1		Dont expect a room with a view, and the hotel is on a fairly busy street, but they do have live jazz nightly.
6688	1		But if you prefer to stay in a cozy and comfortable bed and breakfast type of hotel, the Avenue Garden is the perfect fit.
2089	1		Suggestions: Woodland Park Zoo (fantastic and worth the 10 minute bus drive out of downtown); Anthony's Pier 66 (excellent seafood restaurant on the waterfront) Enjoy your stay at the Moore!
3715	0		As lots of others have said already, all stuff is great and helpful.
6400	0		We stayed in the Kalia Tower which is not one better towers but we were thrilled with everything it had to offer
1817	0		He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay!
1022	1		If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks
3023	0		Pool issue aside, there is a lot to like about this hotel.
3532	0		Also, the food at the nearby Cafe de Tacuba is excellent.
4254	0		The moment we arrived we knew we made the right choice
1445	0		The bed was quite high
3393	0		The room is small ,the width of the room is the length of a kingsized bed,, but it is so well laid out, you would hardly notice the size.
4473	0		We normally go around this time every year and pay about $1500....so I guess you get what you pay for
6616	0		Good value
6437	0		If I hadnt been staying during a peak weekend, I would say that was an outrageous rate, however, given the circumstances, Id say it was fair.
2099	0		However the rooms were clean and the front desk staff incredibly helpful and welcoming.
2150	0		Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be.
1837	0		The location is convenient
2650	0		What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars?
5897	0		The rooms are slightly masculine in feel.
3147	0		The staff were very helpful throughout the stay.
3603	0		We were lucky enough not to get the two twin beds pushed together although this was the hardest bed I have slept on.
599	0		I chose the Palace hotel after doing quite a bit of research on Berlin Hotels.
12	0		Not really our scene.
1288	0		If you rolled you would fall through the cracks.
244	0		They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so.
2993	0		and the hotel was wonderful,
4517	1		So if you make a reservation through internet, you have to call them and confirm it
2503	0		I did not have time to eat.
7338	0		The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.
2290	0		the fan they lend you helped with the road noise and heat.
5375	0		We found the staff very helpful and pleasant.
3401	0		Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town.
432	0		Breakfast is delicious and plentiful.
4797	0		quite adequate for the price
3341	0		HotelConnect, mainly based on the many great reviews here.
3461	0		When I arrived to the hotel I was very sick and he send medicine to my room as well as room service.
994	0		It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room,
908	0		A memeber of our group was sent to another hotel to iron her eveining clothes - when she returned stating that she could not find hotel they directed her the hotel opposite.
2309	0		When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in.
6764	0		The color pallette in the room was very soothing- soft earth tones, beige, brown, merlot.
929	0		and not interested in any problems you may have.
5371	0		The location is superb, the best of New York is at your feet.
5230	0		This hotel was the only one in our price range that would guarantee separate beds.
889	0		We decided to go back and urgue our case.
3676	0		The bathroom was very nice, the bath was really big to lie in.
4504	0		My twin room was small for two and air conditioning barely adequate.
6817	0		We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor.
2625	0		The tub also had long black hair stuck to it (gross).
954	0		Breakfast was hardly worth the effort.
482	0		U-bahn station directly in front of hotel for easy transport to attractions farther west.
3042	0		so it was wonderful for just drive up, have valet take car, bel-hop grab bags and be in room, with bags, in less than five minutes.
7301	0		Im picky when it comes to Thai food, and this met my high standards, and had lovely decor.
3015	0		I won't be staying at this Sheraton again anytime soon.
1507	0		Finally, on my last day when I took breakfast I was treated to a very loud conversation about me by the waiters in the restaurant
4220	0		We took many of the reviewers advice and signed up for the Wyndham By Request.
4237	1		Also, if you are going during baseball season, you will have to buy a Red Sox hat, T-shirt, etc.
1134	0		and we were assigned room 553.
4913	0		Beach - We enjoyed it but we like diving and this is not a good beach for this.
4414	0		The hotel transfer was an additional $20 per person via the website.
4844	0		We spent 5 days at this hotel in August 2007 and will be looking no further when we return to Honolulu.
7156	0		We also all raved about the place and were mad we hadnt left more time to enjoy it.
2809	0		However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club.
2990	0		and furnishings are well thought out.
2692	0		and it was "because it wasn't." I asked if this was acceptable service to them
5324	0		Modern Comfort at the Clarendon Hotel
1358	0		and their food recommendations in the immediate vicinity were right on the mark.
6838	0		From 2PM until 4PM, I was told our room would be avaiable in 20 Minutes.
1734	0		Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort.
1619	0		We did not have breakfast at the hotel but opted to grab breads/pastries/coffee from the many food-outlets in the main stations.
4754	0		I wish the staff well but the rest of it was terrible.
4663	0		Also, for breakfast, the food was OK but there were no English Muffins, minimal pastries and cereals and just not a big selection.
1532	0		We had a south facing room which meant we were away from the main noise from the traffic and could see the main highrises around Alexanderplatz but did overlook some other grotty buildings.
719	0		it is not a good value at all,
5734	1		Do not expect a excellent view, but you cant get it all.
364	1		Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).
983	0		The hotel is very basic
3229	0		I will stay at this hotel everytime I come to New York.
4307	0		The construction noise was VERY loud.
273	0		The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.

1962	0		the rooms were fairly dirty.
4490	0		The hotel was in a perfect location to explore all the sights in Amsterdam.
7154	0		For me, the best feature of this place is the outstanding service by the staff.
6322	0		The staff was extremely helpful and was able to answer all of our questions.
1509	0		and hadn't paid for breakfast.
4662	0		Fish shouldnt smell fishy or like garbage.
4949	0		The only downside of the hotel is that our room faced the side stree ,Eddy?,
2358	0		We will never book this hotel again!
3346	0		Even Portobello - which is in the direct opposite of London - only took less than _?��_��__��_��___ hour by tube.
2526	0		This was our third time staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Downtown Seattle
7124	0		Shopping uneventful, it is a pretty poor country.
6357	0		That place is a mess.
3624	0		Jeff helped us to get the basic necessities and was on the lookout for the police who finally arrived around 3.
1640	0		and sometimes that's all you can ask for.
2458	0		There was no indication that they are trying to look for it.
4715	0		The buffets has soo many choices of food.
662	0		This was a good recommendation.
786	0		they just didn't seem to care much.
2771	0		They will cheat you.
357	0		underneath the bedspread, there are 2 twin comforters, which is wierd for a queen room.
2301	0		It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet.
6531	0		Going back to Bryant Park would feel like going home to a place of warm memories.
6816	0		It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc.
4815	0		The water pressure was horrible and the jets did not work.
4582	0		The front desk staff was very helpful and very welcoming, to us and to our standard poodle.
655	0		Furnishings were dated and floors were dirty.
4325	0		The room we stayed in had some issues with the flooring, but the size and beds were not an issue.
6188	0		The hotel has a decent lobby and reception.
7427	0		The service lady who managed the area did a great job of keeping it clean and prepped.
2142	1		Oh, and they like to keep your key at the front desk - there is only ONE KEY available per room, so if you're sharing with someone but have different itineraries, make a habit of dropping the key off at the front desk.
3947	0		If I had to go to Boston again, I may look elsewhere to stay.
7489	0		Tea bags were provided in the room.
3972	0		We stayed 4 nights here on a first visit to Berlin.
442	0		We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience.
1119	0		That evening we reserved a table for the Fish Buffet for 8pm.
4135	0		Most drinks are made in kind of a big slushy machine, as opposed to a mixer.
2641	0		The towels were thin and scratchy;
168	1		Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.
53	0		The Hotel is less than 1/2 block from the closest U Bhan station - but is situated in a quiet street.
3066	0		Although the room was good sized,
5628	0		Upon finding out my shower didnt work, the indifferent staff gave me a new room after only 10 min of arguing, which was nice.
6920	0		A Hit with my Tech Teen
829	0		But the hotel did not fulfill my wishes, which where a quiet room and a bathtub in the bathroom.
1592	0		I would have found somewhere else to stay if I had the funds
4899	0		The resort was just bought by the Barcelo group and has been branded a four star.
5987	0		Trust me you wont be disappointed.
7168	0		Would happily recommend.
312	0		I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements.
6336	0		When we came back to our room we found a bottle of chilled champagne and a bag of goodies for us to eat.
6242	0		Staff warm,sincere,would like to think its deliberate to employ these type of people, because it works
7203	0		handy hotel for metro.
7152	0		Even getting to and from the airport was a breeze.
6162	0		The guy I roomed with works in pest control and was a stickler about vermin bed bugs etc before we went and he had no complaints unlike some of our other guys who stayed elsewhere in the city so read into that what you will
5069	1		just keep your wits about you and you will have no problems.
6823	0		It was not bad at all, but it wasnt all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery.
2259	0		Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room.
709	0		The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.
7477	0		I think it just may be a sewage problem in that neighborhood of Florence.
6504	0		He inquired how things were going.
832	1		This makes me not want to recommend this hotel.
269	0		Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal.
3772	0		For all the wealth that flows here, you will NOT feel out of place or of a lesser class.
992	0		but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment.
1839	1		As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered.
1736	0		(I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day.
1330	0		In addition, just a stonethrow away, The Palast der Republik was in the process of being torn down.
3858	0		We were charged city taxes of 5.66 euros per night per room.
7226	0		After check-in we moved to the bar for a couple of drinks and found this to be a fun place.

7040	0		,2, it is clean and very modern in decor.
5285	0		Nice room although small.
3446	0		Just got back from a wonderful 4 day trip to NYC and had such a greatl experience staying at the Chelsea Lodge.
5070	0		There are lots of lovely local bars and cafes near the hotel ?
2464	0		Again no indication of any willingness to help.
3856	0		Loved Extase coffee shop, people in Amsterdam were so so friendly I cant begin to say enough
3519	0		Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite.
2637	0		This was one of its sole redeeming factors.
108	0		and the room was small.
7258	0		We never had any trouble finding a hut and did not play the towel game.
5886	0		Extremely friendly and very helpful staff.
1970	0		We ended up arriving at the Warwick at 10pm,
6349	0		I accepted a reservation at the Ohana East, just around the corner.
6168	0		Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet.
2759	0		Good location, but there are many other hotels around.
2808	0		We had a very low rate of $89/night through Priceline with an upgrade to club for only $30/night.
6749	0		Every single person was friendly, helpful, and genuine.
410	0		I challenged the charge in an e-mail to the hotel, and followed up with e-mails to the Hotel (twice), HiltonHonors and Hilton corporate.
3989	0		It struck me that if 6 Motel ever decided they wanted to go resort style this would be the place that they would open up.
554	0		and the smoke wafts through the hotel.
3162	0		Overall, I enjoyed our stay,
5632	0		It is a bit out of the way though, all the way at the of the Rocks.
7323	0		If I did, I would stay at the Millenium Plaza again
1921	0		The bed was comfortable, the amenities average.
5636	0		However, it is noisy.
6997	0		I phoned the front desk to see if everything was okay and they acted like I was nuts to even ask while being up there 7 floors above.
4924	0		Not many hotel kitchens offered food form the region for breakfast during the tour.

1637	0		Room was quiet and clean.

3641	0		It is very well placed for central Paris - 10 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower, Pont dAlma.
1754	0		There is nothing really seriously wrong with the hotel,
6003	0		We asked again to be moved to one of their luxurious suites ,as advertised on their website, and were told they had no such thing as a suite in that hotel.
2802	0		our viewpoint is a bit different than other customers.
5014	0		That was a bid frustrating, but luckily we had the passport.
4463	1		Things to bring ,aside from the obvious, - Antibacterial hand soap for your room, spray air freshner, an alarm clock ,or just a clock as they do no have them in any of the rooms,, Cortizone ,for heat rashes,, Benadryl ,to stop the itching from heat rash...lol,, face cloths ,we got these one day and never saw them again,.
4071	0		Wouldnt recommend horse back riding in Punta Cana, as horses are malnourished and are not what you would be used to.
6867	0		This way they will be held until you return.
1457	0		and this is on a quite street just behind the KaDeWe.
7138	0		We felt very secure and safe here as well.
612	0		Tried the spa- which has everything .
4019	0		The snorkeling in front of the Bavaro was very good and snorkel equipment was free for one hour each day.
4033	0		I stayed at the RIU the last time I visited Miami.
625	0		Just one otherword of advice- and not about the hotel.
1872	0		Unfortunately, I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel.
6159	0		You could hear the doors shut in the adjacent rooms as well, but overall it was a great experience for Times Square during the Christmas season.
3990	0		The comforter and bedding, as well as the entire interior, were all standard Hilton - nothing to connote the southwest ,the comforter was a loudy itchy green floral print,.
5239	0		My three children ages 9, 14, 16 and I stayed at the El Conquistador from Jan 20-25, 2007.
3600	0		Once we did it we started noticing others doing the same thing which does sound like furniture moving.
3197	0		The amenities were lackluster,
5593	0		It was 1:30 am before we could finally settle down and rest.
11	0		And we were really put off by the tourist buses and groups.
3268	0		we stayed one night at the loews hotel miami beach where we have stayed many times and then moved to this hotel for 2 nights.
7469	0		The breakfast is also very nice and plentiful.

3513	0		We were all fed free of charge, breakfast, lunch and dinner and everyone had smiles on their faces.
2408	0		The room was clean and comfortable.
767	0		One thing I didn't realize until the end of my stay was that there is a grocery store just down the street,
6766	0		The room had a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue South and 26th Street.
4885	0		I was served a bowl of RICE drowning in a watery cream sauce with parmesan and canned mushrooms.
6447	0		In the past they washed the car before they returned it to you.
4803	0		The staff though is nice and friendly.
6755	0		Makes me wish I could afford to splurge on hotels like this on my own every once in a while
5961	0		Then after telling htem to come back later.
1055	0		No manners, and I can't recommend this hotel as a great five-star.
977	1		Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!
4906	0		We enjoyed our vacation, but we have stayed at several Gran Bahia hotels befor and found it allitle blaw as we knew what to expect.
4562	0		All restrooms in Restaurants were nice and cleanIn all we paid for a 5***** Hotel and got 3*** Service.
4973	0		The lunch is taken on the rice terraces and staff come from the hotel to prepare it for you.One word of warning our party occupied 2 rooms and both rooms had small items disappear from them during our stay.
5306	0		I like that the hotel was offer free vows renewal which we did.
5588	0		The location is perfect for shopping and restaurants.
6368	0		The next morning ,Saturday, at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot.
3954	0		We arrived in our car after a long journey from Las Vegas, and we were very tired.
508	0		The bathroom here was spacious, but a disabled person (me) would have trouble with the very deep tall tub.
1835	0		the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel.
6630	0		Walter, Melvin and Maria did a great job of drawng the crowd into the activities.
4190	0		Alot less young kids and most of the beach and crazy activities were next door at the dominican so basically our hotel was very relaxing.
3270	0		the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable.
3420	0		Overall Hotel California offers a fantastic value.
1263	0		The location is wonderful.
6478	0		I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars.
1252	0		Unfortunately the hotel does not offer a pillow service and has no alternative to the ones in the room (I asked and failed).
691	0		However one of the redeeming features of the Palace Hotel is its location.
1714	0		I'm not a terribly critical person, but I really hated this hotel.
4591	0		Stayed here about 3 times in the past four years.
6189	0		The room is the best feature - clean and spacious.
6057	0		I cant wait to go back, my husband and I considered the hotel a high point of the trip.
1773	0		We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition.
7183	0		This is all good, and the location is excellent.
3251	0		Good location between Times Square and Central Park, Blue line station on 50th and 8th, walk to theaters, plus hot and cold breakfast with 2 staff members in the dining area.
2191	0		likely because we were drunk when we went to bed so we didn't notice anything.
484	0		Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice.
2075	0		The bedding did not fit the bed
4349	0		The grounds are beautiful, room was nice, and overall we had a good time.
5195	1		If you can get the rate this is a great stopover and the staff have a lot of nice touches like getting us some water for the cab ride back to the airport.
624	0		but this was particularly central.
3625	0		The rest of the staff was very helpful the remaining days of our stay, but we can never thank Jeff enough for his support that evening.
5845	0		It was our first time to the island of Puerto Rico which was not as exciting as we had hoped but the hotel and the service were absolutely superb.
3180	0		but the Andra is about half the price!
5023	0		We would have done better to eat at the Supreme buffet but we were always wet from the ocean/pool.
3642	0		Well served by buses and a metro station less than 5 minutes walk away.
933	0		The room was not very big
1124	0		I questioned him why he had taken our wine order surely knowing full well there was no food left.
6267	0		The room was clean and quiet.
6607	0		Its not the Hyatt, Hilton or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel for the price and location, and only one block from the beach.
6667	0		Every member of the staff bent over backwards to make us comfortable.
6392	0		The Lobby has always been elegant but now it sparkled.
3386	0		But I dont think I would stay here again, I may need to pay more and get more.
4413	0		We booked through WestJet vacations and paid $1169 per person ,taxes in, for the trip.

2488	0		The parking attendants were working hard but still have to wait outside in the cold for your car.
2992	0		I had to stay at this hotel for two weeks for my job
3480	0		It was at this time we tried to contact the Air Transat Holidays representative for Punta Cana, she did not answer at the number we had been given at any time between 7:30 to10:00 pm.
327	0		But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?
6564	0		Wonderful experience.
1336	0		But no problem; there were plenty of opportunities for a very good and inexpensive breakfast within a couple of minutes on foot from the hotel entrance.
3710	0		Aside from my dealings with the owner ,who was less than hospitable and crossed out my entry in their guest book,, the staff were great and the hotel was clean and modern.
5127	0		I turned on the heat and the room was at a comfortable temperature by the time I had finished unpacking.
3337	0		We were asked when we left if we could think of anyway the stay could have been better, we honestyly couldnt hink of anything at all.
5413	0		The hotel is very clean, beautiful and offers friendly service.
866	0		but eventually need renovating.

4337	0		Just in the middle of everything...Museums, Restaurants, Public Transport and lots of Shops.

2193	0		I had booked 2 beds for more space so we thoroughly inspected the other bed and slept in that one.
71	1		Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower.
859	0		The area is full of shops, restaurants, and bars.
1553	0		The trams though only serve the old East side.
3929	0		Only downside was lack of air conditioning in rooms, but in May, it was fine and could open windows to let cool air in when it got warm.
668	0		They certainly live up to the standard of The leading hotels of the world.
3932	0		Only minor point was that they are strict about no ironing in the room and no in room tea/coffee in normal double rooms.
4166	0		The food and wine on level 2 is a great option and my kids loved being able to go down and snack.
735	0		Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm.
7256	0		We have been traveling for the past 15 years to the Carribean and I must say this is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in.

7007	0		Service and food at the Italian resturant was excellent ,Carolynn at breakfast was full of information and was a treasure,.

93	0		but the work-out room was small, dimly-lit, and hot.
1568	0		not to bad, quite spacious and looked clean.
7237	0		There are escalators from the main entrance up to the lobby and they are surrounded by lots of greenery and flowers.
1513	0		In fact, given that and the fact that you basically have to pay for everything in the hotel, including essentials like shampoo, gives the impression that every penny counts and making the guest feel at home comes last.
7411	0		I not only plan on contacting St Vincents, my credit card company, but state and local authorities.
700	0		The health facilities in the hotel are good,
6534	0		I know I can count on that at Bryant Park.

3984	1		If you want out of the hustle more modern surroundings, this is your place.
6161	0		Stayed at the Singel for 2 nights for a football trip, the place is easy to find, in a good location, near the station,on the Singel canal, next to a church.
4062	0		Apple had 2 reps on duty in the hotel lobby and, since they spoke excellent English, they could help us with some of the kinks we had with the hotel.
7495	0		We bought an octopus card at the airport for HK300 which included round trip train from the airport to Hong Kong station and 3 days of unlimited MTR rides.
5126	0		I thought that was a nice touch.
4686	0		80% of the people IN the hotel couldnt care less about whether guests are there.

3636	0		Even refused to call for taxis.
6134	0		Our room was compact but exceptionally clean and comfortable.
6341	0		Relocated to Ohana East This property is now a part of the Ohana and Outrigger family of hotels.
1526	0		Initial impressions of the place are understandibly quite bad.
2726	0		and their own system had logged it in --
729	0		so you have to take itThis is no 5-star hotel.
4108	0		I didnt feel that I was treated any differently or missed out on anything.
5078	0		only downside was that the laminate floors meant that when the cleaners came round in the morning the noise from the corridor was greatly amplified.
6539	0		They look exactly like the room we were in.
1486	0		And this was true in my bedroom
6583	0		I hate that.
2043	0		The front desk staff, however are not helpful and pass the buck so as not to have to deal with a problem.
1195	0		One very unpleasant experience in both the restaurant and the lobby bar area was the mass of fruit flies that became a constant and annoying nuisance.
843	0		Slept VERY well.
3050	0		Since I was working remotely
345	0		The German restaurant, Mark Brandenburg, simply had the best German food I've ever had (and I've been to Germany about 8-9 times).
7328	0		When I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and notified that we were already pre-checked in; handed our room key; and offered some afternoon hot chocolate and fresh fruit in the lobby.
3196	0		However, I strain to compare this boutique hotel to the others I have visited on the west coast.
3819	0		This hotel ruined not only my weekend, but my vacation and the relaxation I hoped to get.
1032	0		Hotel location was good,
5224	1		Be careful where you stay in this city.
2959	0		Kind of small and very crowded with families both times we went.
6547	0		Just enough to start the day
1711	0		When I asked that night, he said we had to call down in the morning....
6287	0		We choose to to eat out for three quarters of the time on the basis of cost and also to experience New Yorkers food
2410	0		each room was furnished with some Chihuly drawings.
1755	0		but it just doesn't have any wow factor.
6753	0		The doormen were consistently friendly.
2975	0		Better bring alot of extra cash.
4362	1		If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful.
6002	0		The small window on the slanted ceiling opened minimally and was of no help.
632	0		Groundstaff couldn't care less.
7263	0		The steakhouse and the Japanese were the best.
1585	0		but they needed a fork ,
1141	0		but rather a ventilation system which did not cool the room down, opening the windows meant that the system switched off
4057	0		A good value, with a few kinks
5007	0		After arriving we were put in building #3.
1495	0		The mark of a good hotel is its ability to deal with the unexpected and its ability to make guests feel at home.
1931	0		Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere.
4114	0		The kids ,7 years old, had a great time and are already asking when we are going to go back.
4434	0		Japanese restaurant - There is a grill at every table so the cook makes the food in front of you.
1023	0		but as it has lots of stairs
4610	0		My cab driver had just gotten his tax the day before.
7208	0		Having said that, the hotel is in a nice quiet spot, with the metro station only 50 yards away, the reception did speak some English which is always handy.
6846	0		but please see my review of the Condado Plaza.
6822	0		We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertowns sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible ,waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift, and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to.
5575	0		The grounds were beautiful, but we noticed some cups in several common areas.... and these same cups remained until the date of our departure.
2093	0		the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s.
1894	0		We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Warwick.
2956	0		Attractive decor.
683	1		I would not recommend this hotel.
6215	0		Everything is within about a 5 minute walk of the Westin
798	0		That just topped it off.
4842	0		A simple nasi goreng was charged at 95000 rupiah in the hotel, and around 22000 everywhere else.
4922	0		We felt that the room was a little small but was kept scupriously clean.
3798	0		I booked a one bedroom ,bedroom, being a key word there, Suite....It was not a suite by any defiinition.
976	0		the one almost opposite -called the Meineke I believe, was good, but we also enjoyed the small restaurant, which you would probably mistake for a bar on the same side as the hotel at the top of the street as you head towards the Ku'Damn.
4073	0		Expect, as with all beach hotels in Punta Cana, people to solicit you frequenty on the beach for tourism trips and excursions, etc.
5273	0		We rarely ever had hot water and everytime I called for help they told me theyre having problems with the steam.
6562	0		That said, Hotel Renew is a lovely addition to Waikiki Beach.
555	0		Housekeeping leaves your windows open to air it out.
5803	0		The rooms themselves are comfortable, but a little on the older side.
6405	0		We had done significant research on hotels in Oahu and I can say after seeing all the other locations we considered such as Sheraton Moana Surfrider, Marriot Waikiki and many others we were thrilled with our decision to stay at HHV.
2722	0		Internet is $9.95 per day.
5269	0		For a fee of course.
2490	0		Overall, an average stay with below average beds.
3026	0		and the staff were super.
1467	0		I just got back from a week stay there.
3071	0		On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable
1512	0		There was no apology from them for the mistake or the inconvenience.
584	0		The bathroom was spacious and immaculate also with the novelty of having a speaker system built in allowing you to listen to the TV while in the bath.
2541	0		This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time.
1763	0		We recently had a wonderful overnight at the Warwick.
2624	0		However, room smelled like wet-dog a bit.
3729	0		I would stay here again.
2986	0		I have stayed at the hotel many times
6839	0		This occured 4 times.
1074	0		In there guest information stated that rooms had access to the internet

4970	0		The staff are very attentive and the service was very good.

6698	0		We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there.
2600	0		We even walked to Pike's Place and the Aquarium one day and the Seattle Center another (yeah, the monorail was down also!).
2359	0		We stayed here for 1 night in August
5063	0		The Spa was top notch, the restaurants were basically the same as any other resort actually better i.e. Sandals, etc.
6345	0		I thought they were updating their standards.
1171	0		We didnt try the restaurant as we prefer to eat out
5591	0		They moved us to another room, this room extremely hot....and the air conditioner did not work.
195	0		It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race.
5709	0		They made our reservations for the Bio Bay tours with Island Adventures and it was perfect.
1523	0		there is too much against it to say this is a good hotel.
5994	0		Our room ,1717, had a great view of the bay, Coit tower and the St. Peter Paul Church Spires.
3441	0		Did have the same problem with aircon but it was stuck on 23C not 25, so not such a problem.
1273	0		The hot has two restaurants, a bar, and a gym.
2098	1		Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit.
3834	0		The people who run this inn are very helpful, friendly, and resourceful.
4901	0		When it was under the old name of Ocean Beach, it was considered a three star.
4240	0		It was so much fun and there are plenty of bars around the park to go to before and after , Game On and Cask n Flagon were our favorites.
2542	0		And once again we ended up with the Sheraton.
5569	0		WE DID THE SAME THING, THOUGH...
4491	0		It was just over 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and a couple of minutes away from Rembrantplein where there were lots of bars, clubs and restaurants.
3878	0		We wanted to make dinner reservations for two nights and asked whether we needed reservations for a third restaurant.
7094	0		Check in was smooth and friendly, the room spotless and quiet, the bed heaven, the bath products really nice, and best of all the location is fabulous - right in the World Square shopping area in Chinatown.
2023	0		I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed,
7371	0		We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold.
1588	0		very inflamed bites which resulted me seeking medical advice about ( not from anyone at the hotel though, I hasten to add!!) Because of the mozzie problem, we ended up having to go through the night with the window shut in a room where the temp was 75 degrees(thermometer in room) so woke up with headaches, sweaty and feeling generally yuk!!
1705	0		(There is a small grocery/wine store across the street that is open until late, which was really nice!) The staff was not friendly, nor helpful.
4164	0		The location is perfect, the staff are mostly fantastic.
6382	1		Both places are highly recommended.
6989	0		Highly reccommend this hotel.
791	0		Roomcleaning takes place in as loud a fashion as possible.
1666	0		and the pool smells like mildew.
2830	0		then that there was only a military rate for the actual active military man and not the spouse.
7376	0		He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see.
3295	0		Great Stay in Downtown Miami
1536	0		Bathroom is basic including a shower cubicle (complete with a large damp patch in the corner).
401	0		If you can get a room at a good price I would stay here
3806	0		The hotels idea of compensasion was breakfast for two.
5801	0		The family that runs the hotel is wonderful, and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome ,in your language when possible, as well as book you reservations and make recommendations.
1974	0		and they said sorry, but since we arrived late they were unable to accommodate us

6699	0		The beach was within easy walking distance.
7064	1		If you go on this trip bring items from your dollar stores ,pencils, markers, coloring books, for gifts for these children and watch their reactions.
2677	0		There's a cool lounge around the corner from the hotel called Vessel with great cocktails, music and interior.
265	0		As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.
319	0		but never before have I been offered a dirty, smelly room and then upcharged for a "renovated" (i.e. clean) room.
4085	0		We were relieved to discvover that the buffet at the Palace was much better - excellent really.
5882	0		Not really the hotels fault, just the location.
1448	0		I complained but was told nothing doing,
4065	1		On your way in, grab one of the oodles of people checking out and get their advice.
7399	0		The main bar was enjoyable and the bartenders gave good service while a lady sang spanish songs, enjoyed that very much and tasted a bit of the national culture talking to locals and watching them dance but this was the only nightlife the hotel offered since they have no live bands or dance club.
435	0		we decided to opt for that.

2586	0		and I cut my foot on a broken drain cover in the whirlpool,
2762	0		Love the new design and the subway tiles in the bathroom.

1781	0		Had a confirmed reservation via hotel website (with a printout in my hand),
3179	0		and the two hotels are very similar in terms of service and room standards,
5119	0		Luckily there was a spot around the corner.
6524	0		I walked past the eager young people hoping to get in, feeling grateful those days were behind me
4043	0		Not worth the reputation
850	0		Staff extremely friendly and helpful.
5155	0		Food was great, pool is awesome.
4914	0		We went to a shop ran by someone from Montreal, it is free to go..
128	0		The funny thing is,
2348	0		Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else].

2638	0		While the room was spacious,
3936	0		While there we visitied places like Pisa ,1hr, and Viareggio ,beaches 1hr 20mins, by train.
27	0		Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide.
3241	1		We had a very pleasant stay and I would highly recommend anyone to stay there.
2966	0		They put us in a small room, with a horrible view.
5917	0		Again, I cant say enough about the staff, just fabulous people.
4948	0		The front desk staff was really friendly and knew a lot about the city.
4716	0		The beach...... the sand is white the water is crystal clear and warm, and nice blue color.

1770	0		we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.
3187	0		We were provided a complimentary upgrade on our room type (without our asking) when the front desk noted that they had room to do so.
559	0		while I was there.
6580	0		The Catalina across the street was a good spot for drinks and for breakfast.

1244	0		Breakfast buffet is superb.

6679	0		We loved our little street-facing room ,the very good windows kept the noise outside, even though it was on the small side, as well as the bathroom and the shower cabin ,overweight people will have problems to take a shower in there,
6214	1		Its also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macys are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place.
3094	0		We loved this hotel in downtown Seattle.
1356	0		Spent five nights and enjoyed the spacious and spotless very bright rooms, modern steam and sauna area with cold plunge, and complete breakfast buffet.
2263	0		Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking.
746	0		however, our guide book had a listing of six special places for breakfast in Berlin.
3110	0		and it was nice too.
6381	0		Based on the comments from another reviewer, we also tried Sears Fine Foods ,near Walgreens, for breakfast, and the Starlight Lounge ,atop the Drake Hotel, for drinks and dancing.
3219	0		The hotel staff was excellent in making it a non-issue.
5581	0		This review is real, and our experiences not exaggerated.

1067	0		Immediately we were meet by the Hotels bell man at the taxi door
7095	0		Its a short stroll to the best yum cha in Australia.
4520	0		But the atmosphere is soul-less.

1877	0		I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips
4943	0		I am very particular about this kind of thing, and have spent a lot of time at other hotels asking to be moved. Not here.
6834	0		At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldnt even pull up in frontI would definitely stay here again if I wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-date just like the good guys
2352	0		We were very dissapointed: Noisy (nightclub next to building, busy street),
4777	0		Its really one of the nicest hotels anywhere and the best airport hotel.
5791	0		so we were more than happy, the hotel staff even moved all of our luggage.
5417	0		With the Sofitel card we also had a 4 PM checkout which was great.

3734	0		Have fun and stay at the San Gallo Palace.
1037	0		Breakfast was very average  waiting staff very average - on the plus side Berlin was amazing the restaurant across the road from the Mark Hotel - The Meineke Restaurant was lovely both food wise  staff wise  there was a little bar on the same side of the road as the hotel but near to Kurfurstendamm str can't remember the name
7111	0		We have been to mexico 5 times and jamaica and we had the best time by ourselves.
571	0		The air conditioning was turned off, even though it was cold outside our room was as hot as a sauna.
5364	0		The Concierge Desk, Victor, Patrick, Mohammed, Jonathan, to name just a few, were always pleasant, efficient and helpful.
4633	0		The Concierge lounge, access to which I receive due to my frequency of Marriott-branded use, was across the hotel resulting in a trip down the elevator, across the lobby and back up.
3276	0		There are two bars an Irish bar a little more casual and the city bar very busy and a little more highbrow.
4202	0		We went in early.
4458	0		Massages - Massage huts all over the resort.
7178	0		Cleaner and safer area.

4707	0		It has a nice swimup bar where the bar tenders are amazing.
1319	0		Great view of the river.
5706	0		Tha hotel is well located from Esperanza, the beach and the restaurants.
4184	1		Cleanliness is not a priority in this area - so go with that in mind.
4374	1		dont trust the staff here
5802	1		The location is amazing, very near the Duomo ,if you are a light sleeper this can be bad for the tolling bells,, just around the corner from the Piazza Republica and down the street from the Uffizi museum and square.
1157	0		One thing we discovered very quickly that in Berlin the hotel you choose is all about location,
1741	0		and the rooms were pretty clean.
2365	0		You had to walk up a tiled step before getting into the tub
7337	0		We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that Im guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.
4743	0		Efficient, No frills
5774	0		This meant no electricity in certain portions of the complex everyday.
6273	0		I was charged for 3 nights rather than just 2.
7107	0		These wonderful people and anyone else whose names I didnt get, made this a wedding and honeymoon well never forget.
340	0		The rooms are beautiful.
4551	0		Lunch Buffet - not enough selection.

6255	0		Summary: I would stay there again ANYTIME: highly recommendable.
3816	0		I was disgusted and appauled by his actions.
3871	0		Went a long way.
5246	0		The dining room had a six seating table, the living room had several wicker chairs w/ cushions a nice sofa and a full sized bed that you pulled out of the wall.
1090	0		I asked to see the manager
7304	0		My daughter is currently contemplating colleges.
2037	0		The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines.
4250	0		For the rate, it has to be the best value and the best comfort in San Francisco.
1190	0		Our disapointment was compounded with the arrival of the bill __�_146 for just 2 courses and wine.
6589	0		Were off to Perth now.
3945	0		We didnt dine at the hotel, although we heard firsthand that there was one restaurant that was very slow in service ,main course took 2 hours,.
4749	0		The breakfast was yukky.
6812	0		Not many tables
5183	0		The only good thing was the location.
3886	0		Despite the intitial problem, it was dealt with in a more than satisfactory way and we would absolutely stay there again.
2698	0		Finally, the manager offered me $50 off my bill.
4235	0		Both were very good.
3811	0		Seems like this would be the end of the nightmare right? WRONG
802	0		The hotel claim that this is a standard room for two is based upon the size of the bed which nearly fills the space of the room.
2602	0		A few interesting things I noticed, lots of people smoking,
4669	0		Needless to say, breakfast that day, and each subsequent day was cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du Monde.  YUM
6480	0		I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.
4481	1		Avoid it.
2315	0		It is noisy on the weekends,
5730	0		The hotel is close to WTC but to close to La Rambla for my tast.
6559	0		The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries.
2571	0		The service was horrendous,
4572	0		For those concerned about the neighborhood- its SF, get over panhandlers.
6638	0		Not A Golf Resort
2367	0		There was no space near the tub to hang a towel.

1024	0		and no lift it is also below standard.
1373	0		they organise private parties on the seventh floor of the hotel,
664	0		The room is modern and has a good size.
293	0		The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while.
6395	0		They know I love the fabulous chocolate chip cookies they make--and the night before I left--they had a tray of them sent to my room with a fond farewell written out in chocolate.
5401	0		Rooms were great, as well.
105	0		There was no luggage rack
444	0		and truly went out of their way to make our stay more special.
301	0		Reception staff were plain rude
6321	0		Preciados is centrally located and within walking distance of the major sites in Madrid: Puerta del Sol, Teatro Opera, the Palacio Real, Catedral Almudena, etc.
1404	0		and both are convenient to Berlin's extensive public transport.
3512	0		Cant commend the staff highly enough including the General Manager Greg, during this difficult time.
2450	0		I usually leave a decent tip everyday with a Thank you note in the room for the maid when I stay in a hotel.
7236	0		The hotel itself is very lovely.
5033	0		We visited the Bahia Principe next door and were VERY glad we chose the Majestic as their layout is much more preferred.
218	1		If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.
3417	1		If youre heading to Tokyo, whether its business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - its all good.
5349	0		After the receptionist put the phone down she then informed me that they did have a room afterall, but we could not check in after 2pm.
6513	0		Dont be thrown by the hip appearance of the staff in black.
1887	0		Made a reservation using the 50% Entertainment book discount (mentioned at time of reservation) and when we went to check in,
5016	0		The food doesnt even compare to cruise food.
1100	0		The room was a bit shabby,
2343	0		I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller].
5768	0		The bugs are still there and now the room smells like raid.
2117	0		he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue.
1723	0		The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean.
2593	0		Parking at $28 was obscene and the $1.50 for 6 oz.
1995	1		but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).
3037	0		There are lots of great shops around the hotel.
1132	0		and strangely enough there was no porter available to help us with the luggage.
3163	0		but next time would stay somewhere less expensive.
6567	0		Will definately stay there again
334	0		The room service was also quite good, and the staff friendly and (for the most part) helpful.
5561	0		And tipping made no difference ,we would NEVER consider not tipping,.
1775	0		Perhaps some rooms have decent views
5264	0		But when you get there it is worth the wait.
2329	0		Its old and any improvements/repairs all look completely half baked.
3394	0		The pod toilet is private enough that you dont feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room.
1120	0		Arrived at 8 promptly.
6130	0		The staff was so nice and helpful, they really added to our wonderful week in Seattle.
2892	0		$40. That's dinner for 2 every night!!
6165	0		Thoroughly modern, great views ,we were on the 31st floor,.
5647	0		Breakfast is also served here and was a peaceful orderly event of an extremely high standard.
1271	0		I stayed in a business class room on the sixth floor.
5691	0		The hotel lobby, hallways and elevators are not at all impressive and very small, but the large clean rooms are a pleasant surprise when you open the room door.
198	0		and he eats quite a bit.
6526	0		I researched this trip weeks in advance.
3758	1		I would not suggest doing this without fins unless you are VERY strong swimmer and even take caution with fins if you are a strong swimmer.
4259	0		The bathroom was huge, spotless and beautiful
5146	0		I went with my daughter and my 2 grandsons.
3509	0		Right across from the International Market Place and close to any shop or bus stop or anything you wanted.
4424	0		We had a jacuzzi in the room with a king sized bed and we were 10 steps away from the beach
7102	0		Every single employee treated us as royalty, or better yet as their family.
5311	0		I can go on and on about the Outrigger, but I will end it here.
215	0		and the lobby is very pritty and impressive.
13	1		If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel.
4357	0		We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away.
4621	0		First, there were two uniformed associates outside, a doorman and a bellman.
4879	0		My next favorite was the Spanish, which had great selection and atmosphere ,note that the drawback to the Brasilian was the LACK of atmosphere - no music, glaring lights,.
6561	1		However, if you plan to take an afternoon nap, bring ear plugs.
3662	0		We will definetely go back.
6220	0		Although there are a lot of coffee shops nearby, I decided to head to Pike Place Market and see what I could find there.
3265	0		The courtesy bus was excellent and always available. A great hotel
2376	0		but for the location and price it was worth the 1 night stay.
2746	0		I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb.
1172	0		but it seemed quite nice and very popular.
1917	0		Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day.
6848	0		My sister and I stayed at this resort from Apr 26 - May 2, this year, 2008.
3039	0		It was a comfortable, spotlessly clean, well located hotel, great value for the price we paid (an online special summer rate).
4649	0		She took it upon herself to escort me to the front desk for a room change.
5808	0		The lobby was decorated beautifully and the staff were very friendly.
2041	0		My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November.
371	0		The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.
3736	0		walls are made of paper,
2219	0		We stayed in The Moore in May, 2007 for 2 nights.
4364	0		I thought the food was good and we enjoyed the open air cafe and the music at night.
6451	0		I have also stayed at the Sheraton LAX and it was better.
6833	0		You just have to pull up and get dropped off.
6857	0		We ate there during most of our stay.
4105	0		We were only able to eat at one of the a la carts, The Italian, because the other ones did not have a non-vege option.
1423	0		and this is where my case was kept.
4926	1		Much better option is to venture a little into the side streets.
4915	0		not a good place to get presents very costly, but nice.
5940	1		Although there are many choices, dont go with an expectation that you will be having a fine dining experience.
7186	0		The lighting is a weak point as well, and so is the noisyness between rooms.
5831	0		The beds were super comfy and the shower was awesome
7447	0		Our room was very clean.
6969	0		We are not big drinkers, but do appreciate a well-made cocktail.
6015	0		Rooms were clean and comfortable.
6291	0		The overall experience was greater than the sum of the parts.
7312	0		Great Staff nice reception hour and excellent service.
5112	0		Say hello to him-their best employee
2788	0		There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests.
1186	0		It took a telephone call from us to the manager before room service would replace it with the genuine article.
6968	1		Other than the frozen drinks, I would not reccommend a mixed drink here.
4600	0		Room: Large, well furnished and stylish, but the sink, toilet and bath all overflowed.
6758	0		I usually stay at a Starwood property like the W when in NYC, but this time I decided to go for a more personal experience.
2346	0		Totally unacceptable as a lone female.
2052	1		However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car.
7385	0		Excellent location Excellent location for main shopping areas and good for using public transport to other parts of the city and airport.
5599	0		We originally booked a partial ocean view to save money.
1071	0		but they were fully booked.
6099	0		I had some febreeze so it was bearable.
7306	0		The Kimberly Hotel was in a great location, the staff could not be more helpful and the rooms were large enough to accommodate a crabby teenager and mother without any fuss.
4280	0		It was not much better but at least the toilet didnt leak and the sheets looked clean.
2175	0		They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead,
4809	0		The beach and the hotel lobby was beautiful however, the room left a lot to be desired.
3622	0		We called Jeff at the hotel to tell him we would be late and to be sure and hold the room.
6721	0		I cant describe how perfect our stay at this hotel was....I cant wait to go back
669	0		The only minus is the additional costs.
6438	0		For any time of normal demand, Id say that anything less than $120 would probably be a good value.
7533	1		you dont need a blow dryer one is provided, if you want to buy rum and cigars either get them at the Hotel or go to the factory.
3630	1		Stay elsewhere if at all possible.
7036	0		We loved several things about the Ayre: ,1, it is QUIET.
1478	0		Very arrogant, not helpful at all.
6039	0		I decided to stay in
4476	0		The rooms are small but very cozy, we would definitely stay here again.
3517	0		We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way.
3450	0		Shared toilets are not a problem at all.
5674	0		The service wasnt great but it was OK.
150	0		Our room was very nicly furnished and clean with a large bathroom.
5820	0		It was around the same price as some of the more traditional hotels on La Ramblas but you got so much more for your money.
2632	0		Not knowing that the cabs did not return to that area.
1473	0		and the hotel is close to the more interesting neighborhoods of Schoneberg and Kreuzberg (maps are deceptive these areas are easily in safe walking distance of the hotel even though they appeared to be further away)Overall this hotel is fine for a basic safe modern hotel
5029	0		I probably enjoyed the main buffet the best just for the variety.
4682	0		In conclusion, New Orleans needs support.
1050	0		This hotel is lovely.
4068	0		Beaches are monopolized by beach huts and restaurants, so dont expect a room right on the water.
2876	0		I asked that the fax, when found, be delivered to my room.
6297	0		Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel for the price we paid.
3364	0		No attempt was made to look for it.
4149	0		The beds were heavenly as promised, and the dual shower was great too.
6717	0		They suggested restaurants and treated the kids like family.
5493	0		This is perhaps the beat hotel I have visitied in the United States.
817	0		The room was on the corner, facing a really noisy street, which meant I had to keep the window shut at night.
620	1		YOu do have to shop around on the newt to get best deal.
3367	0		Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.
3594	0		The cava at reception is a nice touch though we had to ask for a glass ,?,
3934	0		Its less than a 5min walk from the station, so is a perfect base for visiting florence and surrounding towns/cities.
7479	0		I am not a small person and the bathroom in the ecomony room suited my needs fine.

417	0		A great choice!!
2881	0		I complained to the manager on duty the next morning
3959	0		The rooms were slightly outdated, with stripy coloured wall-paper, and country style curtains.
2085	0		Pike's Market, shopping and restaurants are all close by.
7506	0		The staff at the front desk treated guests like robots.

1317	0		We stayed in a Business Suite.
7250	0		The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway?
1926	0		Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet).
7326	0		We LOVED it
1803	0		but you do not worry too much about quality.
6878	0		The bartenders/waiters are so friendly that they ask you not only if you are enjoying yourselves but where you are from and so on.
240	0		If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel.
4106	0		But the buffet was delicious and diverse enough to keep our palettes satisfied-
466	0		Our room was clean
400	0		The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb.
4965	0		Breakfast was on until 11 every morning and had a great selection from scrambled eggs to pastries.

4376	0		attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students.
6925	0		I booked a room with a single queen bed through Cheap Tickets and was happy with Divas responsiveness to my e-mail request to give us two beds , they gave us a room with a king and the Murphy bed, both very comfortable,.
1047	0		meanwhile the lovely modern shower fixtures fell off the wall every single morning
5848	0		The room was fantastic and clean and well designed .

5530	0		Our room ended up not being ready until 6 PM that evening--arrived 3 PM.
3451	0		Great air conditioning...and we needed it as it was very hot.
1069	0		Swift check in, so far so good.
1551	0		I would say one thing though, coming home when its dark to the hotel is quite off putting as its not very busy at all and very dark in places
4410	0		Could be a real gem since it is an older property/building and could get some of its original character back with some renovating, and better front desk staff.
6128	0		There is a coffeemaker in the room, a nice hairdryer, iron and ironing board and a safe in the closet.
3820	0		Feel free to contact me via E-mailZacharias J ReisPba_fla@yahoo.com

5857	0		Location is brilliant, right next to the bustling Clarke Quay with its many bars and restaurants.
740	0		and the toilet door is opaque.
393	0		There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel).
2828	0		First I was told that there was a military rate,

5343	0		Great Location ,behind the Flower Markets,
5445	0		Only a block away from a laundromat.
1397	0		Location is fine, place is clean, and no problems with the bathroom, but oh that postage-stamp bed for two ...
3340	0		Had booked this hotel for a 10-night stay ,got a great deal via
7512	0		He was the most hospitable of all the staff.
1654	0		Not so.
3078	0		and that's the only place I'll stay next time.
2792	0		We found a nice big room, with a comfortable bed, new linens, very clean and modern bathroom.
6560	0		Of course, if you plan to be at the beach or out touring all day, then the noise is not a problem.
6571	0		It is a decent budget option in the right room.
3302	0		The amenities are Aromatherapy Associates of London - smell of lavender and rose - delightful, conditioner is great.
3530	0		By international standards, the price of the room was very reasonable.
847	0		Overall, we were very pleased with our pick and would definitely stay there again.
763	0		There is a tiny elevator, which is nice if you have a heavy suitcase.
3342	0		And it fully lived up to our expectations
7314	0		Keep up the good work.
2550	0		The room that they gave us looked out into the alley
2398	0		and great for shopping and the linens and bed were very comfortable.
1430	0		I insisted on changing rooms and was eventually given a room on the executive floor.
3645	0		Shower area was small though and door didnt fit so the floor got wet
6650	0		We kept the heater on to drone out the noise.
703	0		The spa facilities are also nice but cost an extra __�_7 per day.
3336	0		You cannot go wrong.
5400	0		VERY beautiful and stylish lobby.
7525	0		We wanted to upgrade so we were closer to the beach.
4294	0		Room size is average.
4712	0		This resort you know your eating beef.
5010	1		One thing you must ask for when checking in is a Majestic Passport.
2775	0		A few days later a co-worker called and was able to book a room and received the government rate.
6570	0		But of course, since its one of the least expensive hotels in South Beach, its not exactly a high end experience.
2498	0		It would not reach a warm temperature.
1284	0		Though clean the rooms are a bit bare,
1416	0		No air-conditioning, characterless rooms althought they were clean.
4498	0		The bedroom was a little tight but the living and study space was slightly bigger.
7397	0		I had a good dinner at Bamboo ,japanese, one night but was not able to get in for the rest of my stay.
2292	0		The young fellow at front desk was a pleasure to talk with.
2133	0		and more options are available for shoppers, diners, beer and cocktail seekers than ever before.
1030	0		So, some of the poorest service I have ever experienced, misleading advertising, surly/miserable/rude staff and awful public areas.
645	0		Best breakfast place we found (but there are many) was in Fasanenstrasse No.
3153	0		I did not find the hotel to be noisy,
5544	0		Refills were offered twice during our entire stay in the main dining room.
6814	0		The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all.
1819	0		The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful  unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude.
4171	0		Despite this, I would stay at Casablanca again if I was lucky enough to come to New York.
1990	0		Some were complaining about not getting the room they were promised, along with others.
2478	0		I believe the lobby has free wireless,
4241	0		This hotel had a knowledgeable, professional and friendly staff - their recommendations of a Chinese restaurant in nearby Chinatown or of a restaurant in close North Beach were spot-on when I made clear my price range and my expectations.
95	0		There was also one ratty, old floor mat.
2694	0		The manager worked really hard and offered up the sincerest "sorry" he could muster.
6337	0		It was such a wonderful surprise we went back down to thank them.
2295	0		thanks again Moore hotel!!
2280	0		It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city.
4137	0		That said, my wife and kids enjoyed virgin pina coladas very much.
2549	0		and the hallway had bits of garbage all throughout that no one bothered to clean up during our stay.
2823	0		The front desk employees were rude, whether it was on the phone or in person, didn't matter.
3127	1		If you are flying in I would suggest not renting a car as down Seattle can get crazy  parking is expensive.
5763	0		Upon further investigation I found out the resort was operating at less than 20% capacity.
3113	0		If we knew that then we would of been happy to have a room in the old tower.
2039	0		The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport.
4852	0		Some good, some bad
6763	0		The room was absolutely perfect.
402	0		but if paying rack rate there are other hotels with far superior facilities available in Berlin
5754	0		We arrived at the Paradisus around 4pm on the 18th and were greeted with a strawberry fruit drink while checking in, in the expansive, gorgeous open air lobby.
6238	0		Far cry from business type hotels
4391	0		The staff were polite and friendly.
4432	0		There was no limit on the amount of reservations you were allowed.
5282	0		Just spent 5 days at Hilton with wife and two teenagers.
6421	0		No comment on the rooms as we did not see them.
6530	0		I think I have stopped looking when it comes to New York.
3382	0		Furniture was old and shows the wear and tear.
395	0		Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar.
1258	0		rooms were in need of repair.
3444	0		I would agree that sometimes the standard isnt great all the time, but they do at least make the effort, which is half the point in my opinion.
3706	0		I was attracted to Hotel Fita by its location and offer of free internet and long-distance telephone.
245	0		The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy.
1014	0		Suddenly, the receptionist found a reservation for us which means that they had expected us all along and was about to check us into that hotel when she realised that her colleague had sent us off to another property.
4573	0		Our corner room doubled as a fire escape, which allowed opening the window for fresh air.
3101	1		I would definitely recommend this hotel.
2554	0		Needless to say, I don't think that we will be staying at the Sharaton any time soon.
291	0		The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it.
7482	0		Bottom line, it is a great value but it does have some significant problems if you are in the wrong room.
187	0		and I think it is just greedy to keep it open but treat it's guests as second class citizens.
511	0		There are abundant taxis here
1152	0		But at least it was quiet.
6510	0		I am not particularly drawn to trendy.
2135	1		Request a 6th or 7th floor room facing the water and you'll enjoy a view that most visitors pay through the nose for.
6671	0		The chef is outstanding.
5765	0		I called the front desk and was told someone would be out immediately.
7505	0		The hotel was selected due to the proximity of a convention I attended at the Mascone Convention Center.
752	0		The staff was friendly and completely bilingual.
2256	0		First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle.
3008	0		The layout of the furniture was spartan at best.
4542	0		We asked for another room, no answer.
5871	0		the room has a bed, a balcony, and a bathroom and that is it.
3328	0		The breakfast room was very well presented, and you can also breakfast outside or in the bar area.
3487	0		We had to keep our dirty towels or go without.
279	0		The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas.
1624	0		but i found it clean.
4658	0		OK, the first night, everything was seafood which I dont eat.
1461	0		but this was the guy I complained to so we probably got off on the wrong footing.
3744	0		Great location and service
5793	1		Breakfast was quite pricey at 18euros each, but it was a buffet you could eat as much as you like, so if you have a big appetite, perhaps its good value, and if you didnt want to pay 18euros then dont eat it...
6001	0		I asked why the air conditioning was not on, and was told they turn it off during this time of the year.
478	0		Stayed 3 nights in March.
5150	0		They dont have water systems like we do.
1108	0		most seemed a bit scary!.
5580	0		This resort even tried our patience.
7109	0		Loved our Room
707	0		and I. I was excited when we first checked in because the lobby is very grand and fairly well appointed.
5188	0		Hyatt failed to take care of us before and after this incident and for that I can never recommend them again.
1798	0		A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day.
1156	0		We stayed at the sofitel for two days on a jolly to Berlin.
1841	0		trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day.
5778	0		The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations.
2640	0		the linens were of the cheapest quality.
7340	0		There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room.
6054	1		Note that the hotel offers great packages on its website - the best way to go.
4631	0		The pools are closed for repair.
1966	0		and they also did not have that...
499	0		Christmas in Berlin was a wonderful experience here.
823	0		Like someone has already pointed out; they seemed to struggle keeping up with things.
696	0		However it is in close proximity to the major shopping street (Ku_��_damm) and other tourist attractions (e.g. the Zoo, Aquarium, Kaiser Wilhelm Church, the Ka-De-We Dept Store).
2441	0		I booked this Sheraton hotel in downtown Seattle via Hotwire for two nights.
3105	0		but they held our bags for us  we just went out and grabbed some lunch.
6849	0		Oeverall, it was a great experience and we are considering coming back to the Majestic.
3701	0		Youre right across the street from Dukes bar and the Mai Tai bar at the Royal Hawaiian
7201	1		If youre in the mood to splurge, the Royal Hawaiian ,pink hotel, has a great breakfast but it is pricey.
6716	0		The concierge staff is the best in the world.
180	0		and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate
1369	0		and no-one gave me the wakeup call I asked for.
3957	0		We have stayed in numerous hotels before and more than half did not give us connecting rooms.
190	0		I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon.
7210	0		Not having stayed in any other hotel in Paris I did not have anything to judge it on, but if we went again i think i would look around first.
4968	0		This was situated in its own walled garden with water on 2 sides and a bath leading from the bathroom, surrounded by water.
3810	0		I decdied to find another hotel, at a higher rate, and after driving 4 hours on no sleep after working a 12 hour shift.
923	0		Reception wasn��_t the friendliest but did their jobs well.
4741	0		the hotel and the rooms were imaculate, ohh and what a room.
4995	1		Dont miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue.
6094	0		Our room was dark due to subdued lighting and a small window, but to be fair I did ask for a quiet room.
1667	0		Seriously.
4384	0		Im going back there this year and will definately stay there again.
777	1		The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.
4200	0		The 19 year olds and the 22 year olds went to the Star rock cafe at night.
6685	0		The hotel is located right on the trolley line ,with RTA passes available at the front desk, and the ride to campus or downtown is no more than twenty minutes.
214	0		Still, the location is the best
1617	0		Concierge is not available 24 hours.
964	0		The only good thing we can say it that the hotel is in a very good position just off ku'damm and great for exploring Berlin.
3192	0		I'm confident that we couldn't have found a better boutique hotel for a better price.
1093	0		With a bit of insistence, she moved us into a 4+-star room.
4409	0		Slimey, dirty tiles.
82	1		Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..
5873	0		but you should be out enjoying the city anyways.
5518	0		The room was modernly decorated and within easy walking distance of Grand Central Station and the subway.
433	0		I believe the hotel is best for business clientle.
1294	0		It is well situated and has an impressive lobby,
2456	0		I called the hotel immediately.
5611	0		It was supermarket quality.
2147	0		there are a couple of luggage carts that you can wheel your stuff about.
1482	0		and they just changed the sheets once
5091	0		Overall, an excellent choice
7508	0		Management was rather rude to another fellow union member who wanted to bring in food and drinks for personal consumption.

574	0		Bathroom hairdryer is impossible to style your hair with,
7047	0		Sometime in the future the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya will be turned into a mall, but for now the only thing you can walk to from the hotel is the hill of Montjuic, which has the art museum, the fountain that is lit up at night, various botanical gardens, various smaller museums, the Spanish Village, and the cable car up to the castle.

2113	0		I reported them to Visa.
6474	0		Also had a fabulous meal at the Metro Grill next door.
5312	0		Ok lets start, check in went well, until we found out we had two double beds instead of the king we asked for when we booked the trip back in nov.Not a big deal.
2786	0		and the prices are outrageous for very average food.

7270	0		good liquor selection; self-serve, soft-serve ice cream at the outdoor bars.
1428	0		On the third day I tackled them again about the problem .
2519	0		Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes.
6051	0		The hotel is still new, so their bar wasnt open, but their sauna was great.
2491	0		I travel for a living

3100	0		and we were pleasantly surprised at the great continental breakfast.
1342	0		Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result.
4318	1		So if you have trouble with stairs request a lower floor.
191	0		As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties

1302	0		Have to note though that the doorman was VERY HELPFUL.
7206	0		The room was very small with an even smaller bathroom,although it had just been refurbished, the air-con unit would blow out air, but not very cold air and therefore never switched off.
1344	0		A full-length shower curtain would've been a much better option.
5308	0		It was free so we did it.
1505	0		The main difficulty with that is that all the files that I have on my laptop that I need to be able to send to my office can't be transferred to the PCs in Reception.
831	0		Instead I got a family room facing a noisy street and a tiny shower.
5393	0		The famous one on Nob Hill doesnt even offer that

2691	0		I asked them why the room wasn't ready

6465	0		Yes, this was a big surprise to us.
5839	0		it was amazing.
318	0		I have long suspected that hotels reserve the smallest room, the one with the worst view, or the one by the elevator, for guests who pay a discounted rate ...
6230	0		Its a little on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for
5867	0		The last bus from the centre to the hotel leaves at 02:45am
6844	0		The poolside food was vertually inedible, soggiy cold sandwiches, and watered drinks.
1986	0		Then, another bellhop was passing by others with children in the lobby and scowled at them for no reason at all.
3963	0		The meal arrived in about 35 minutes and was v.good.
476	0		The last time we stayed in Berlin (June),

1131	0		We arrived at the hotel at 7pm
6664	0		I selected the Toren based on its location and the previous reviews.

3492	0		The beach staff at the Flamenco were interested only in selling us the motorized sports that were not included in our package.
4519	0		the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money.
221	0		Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel.
6887	0		Mainly Europeans with the balance being Canadians and Americans.
5959	0		The every morning at 8:00 AM housekeeping would knock.

7191	0		It was recently renovated and the hotel property did a very good job.
6928	0		The room was clean and fresh smelling.

6543	0		Our overall experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this hotel property, with one caution that I will address later in this review.

59	0		May be the restaurant have something,
4937	0		it is a very noisy hotel -- do NOT get a room in the upper 20s.
3397	0		Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod.

4146	0		She said her right ear was also ringing in the historic room... very spooky

1641	0		The previous positive reviews must have been from those who were given OUR room.
5432	0		The rooms are a bit small for the price of the room.
1154	1		Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).

2211	0		There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle.
5307	0		We were there for our 2nd anniversary.

4338	0		This hotel was recommended by friends and we are very greatfull they told us about the hotel Aalders.

4136	0		The bartender just adds liquor to it and here you go.
1178	0		small duty free in a cabin, I would definately stay at the sofitel again rather than risk a hotel in the wrong place which would seriously dent your enjoyment of a short stay

280	0		Everything worked well though
6231	0		Great time had by all
3711	0		Good enough, but not that great.
7032	0		This Hotel differs from the usual HI Exp as it was a little different because of all the old world touches with it being in part of the old Cotton Exchange, rather than a new purpose build hotel like many of the HI Exp.
5819	0		A colleague and myself stayed at 1898 at the beginning of July for a work trip.
169	0		I do not know what the quality of the rooms are like in the new part of the hotel.

3882	0		We walked back to the hotel to check on the other reservations with the evening concierge.
314	0		Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly.
1527	0		Its right in the heart of the old East Berlin so every building in the area is communist in design, rectangular and not pretty and surrounded by busy main roads.
4540	0		No extra bedding for the night because it was sometimes cool.
5726	0		I am not in any way saying dont go, it is a very beautiful country, most people are nice, but, there is not a lot of places to go like in Mexico, where you can take a bus and you are at the shopping mall in 10 min.
341	0		The pool and gym are are really beautiful.
4972	0		You will go out with a guide and experience the countryside at close quarters.
7017	0		Food was outstanding - everywhere.
2924	0		I would go somewhere more unique.
531	0		and there are always some people inside smoking cuban cigars which makes the air inside unbearable.
936	0		Although the bed linen was clean there wasn't much going for the room at all.
3324	0		Breakfast was very good, cheese and cold meats, boiled eggs yoghurts, cereals, juice and a wide array of pastries and fresh fruit.
6509	0		Yes.It is very trendy.
204	0		and runners go by from my window.
234	0		It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital.
526	0		The Savoy is a very nice hotel with antique furniture but still a kind of trendy look.
5366	0		Engineering and Housekeeping responsed promtly to any request ,to repair a light or a choice from their wonderful pillow menu.
651	0		Why so dear??
3657	0		It was wonderful.
3013	0		a construction crew convened.
6358	1		Rooms are clean and nice, but bear in mind you just pay for lodging, service does not seem to be included.
6328	0		Everyone we encountered was extremely courteous and friendly.
7298	0		The restaurants serve on Island Time as well, but there is always the buffet, which was delicious.
6528	0		I declined to stay at one of their proerties because I wanted something different.
438	0		We were a bit annoyed because the location of the hotel had been our primary reason for booking.
5855	0		Beautiful decor and great views from the 3 windows in the room
564	0		but the weekend front desk staff can be rude.
4800	0		Rooms are tiny and the housekeeping isnt there after 1pm, so if u came back late and wanted to sleep in ur room wont get cleaned that day.
5097	0		Just stayed night of 14th November 2006, got a very good rate including buffet breakfast from Hotel.com
5220	1		I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a bit of style and comfort.

6171	0		Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation.
2559	0		the lobby is outrageously crowded and bustling with groups.
5118	0		Great location, fantastic staff
2789	0		The Seattle Sheraton has no sense of customer service.
3780	0		The only fault we would find is in the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms.
1480	0		Kind of small, bad furnished and without any air-conditioning.
1175	0		Top tip: if you fly in
6952	0		We love the pink, the private beach, the whole opulent feel of the hotel.
621	0		I got mine from Bookings, which had the advantage of not taking all your money up front on a no cancel deal (like some of the others try to do...) Hotel is well placed for Shopping, busses and U S Bahn lines.
2332	0		I thought Seattle was great - plenty of specialty shops, restaraunts, coffee shops, pubs, and clubs, plus the water.
3116	0		I have a larger laptop
4706	0		It has beds in the pool in the shade and also in the sun.
1194	0		and it is not ideal to be given the option of breakfast in the reception atrium while being gawped at by tourists along with the fish!
56	0		It was supposed to be a designer hotel,
3348	0		Beds comfy, room spotless, good sanitary appliances as opposed to usual British plumbing
3484	0		That made all their restaurants under some degree of renovation with no clear plan on how to provide food services to their guests.
43	0		this won't ring your bell as all destinations will require at least a half hour walk or public transport journey.
3032	0		The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating,
4527	0		The restaurant was expensive so we ate locally at more moderately priced restaurants, of which there are many within easy walking distance.

2208	0		The room was huge, while sparsely decorated.
3883	0		Neither had been made.
1176	0		and out of Tegel airport dont go through the security
1764	0		It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping.
7169	0		Not Worth the Savings
7145	0		It was a very relaxing stay.
6888	0		A lot of families and couples.
7084	0		The bird droppings often found in the Mirador Grill usually found on the plates and tables did not help.....disgusting and certainly not acceptable in the light of the bird epidemic.
4350	0		The main issue we had was that scuba diving was not available all week.
2590	0		and all they said was they were sorry.
4771	1		I was here many times before and have seen all kind of rooms , make sure, you get an renovated one with Heavenly Bed,.
6179	0		The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad.
780	0		but I found this hotel quite bad.

5443	0		DVD with movies to borrow nice after a full day of sightseeing.
3782	0		The hotel is well located and the renovated rooms were adequate in terms of size and amenities but I would not rate them 4 star.
1578	0		and eventually got a table.
5368	0		We were a little baffled, as the light repair on the desk had been attended to, anyway we enjoyed the chocolates, but ,later in the evening as we turned on the television we realized that the television had been replaced with a flat screen model.
483	0		Note breakfast and 24-hours of Internet use were an extra 22 euro each.
6784	0		And, finally, on weekdays between 5 and 8 p.m. they serve complimentary wine and cheese accompanied by piano music.
3617	0		Most of the reviews stated that the staff was very helpful and friendly.
5495	0		I booked my room on priceline for $55.00 per night ,plus I had a free upgrade coupon to the club floor,.
6992	0		Pool was warm, hot tub was non-existent it was covered up or under construction on what looked to be not touched in a long time.
7478	1		Avoid the first floor and you will be fine.
942	0		The shower had no height adjustment bar
2123	0		That's the worst of it.
5296	0		The location was the best.
1285	0		they were a bit cold to me (some may like this).

6794	0		We spent most of our time sightseeing and found the convenience of getting to and from the hotel ideal.

3815	0		I decided that Mr. Sims would change his tune when he was confronted with this issue in person, and in front of other guests....I was wrong.
7222	0		We stayed at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott for one night before boarding a cruise out of Brooklyn.
2770	1		Be careful with this hotel.
2661	0		We go to Seattle often,
575	0		it took me 4 calls to the concierge before an alternative was provided.
225	0		I concur with previous reviews;
3469	0		There was not enough seating for the number or guests and because the buffet was divided into two sections; it was necessary to go to both lines to obtain a complete meal.
6669	0		Immediately they began to set up the room, adding a second bed in a VERY large room, overlooking the canal.
5896	0		Despite that the service was great, the room was luxurious and we had a great time.
6295	0		The hotel is close to all the major attractions.
5696	1		We were in a deluxe room ,dont be fooled, these are the basic rooms, which was really small, compared to the fantastic villa we had in Benoa for less then half the price,
4710	0		I have been to Punta Cana 3 times and hands down the food at this resort has got to be the BEST.
6277	0		Simply The Best
588	0		Breakfast was fantastic.
3759	0		Currents can be dangerous and ther are no warnings.
6924	0		But best of all in her opinion were the iMacs and free internet access on every other floor, with the Starbucks leading off the front lobby a close second.
6601	0		Reading some of the recent reports makes me wonder what people expect for around $100 bucks a night??
7075	0		We were told prior to getting to the hotel that our reservation had been honored, mind you we paid up front.
4225	1		Some suggestions for those going for a long weekend trip .... Book the Beantown Trolley Tour.
4094	0		Poor Hotel and Staff
4336	0		The rooms were clean and the location of the hotel was great.
5629	1		Overall, if cost is a main concern, and you want stay in a basic room for $50 with decent service, in an acceptable neighborhood, then you apparently dont have enough $$$ to stay in a San Francisco hotel, try an upgrade to a local hostel, or stay home.
1053	0		This is a five star property!
1334	0		Breakfast was not included in our Expedia booking,
5912	0		We never determined if it was the water and dampness in the room if we didnt leave our windows open ,our guess,, our someone in the courtyard with a deep love of boiled cabbage.
2268	0		Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!
6488	0		Marble bathrooms have deep soaking tubs,a shower that has a floor to celing glass door with 2 shower heads ,rain shower above, telephone shower mid-range, and a thermostat controlled steamer, allowing you to set time and temp
5419	1		I highly recommend this hotel especially for couples.
6635	0		The lady at the frount desk admited they have been overbooking pepole for some time and that we are not the first to be in that problem.
4408	0		The pool area is nice but the pool itself could use a good scrub down.
5565	0		Breakfast was a bit better, and we realize this is not fast food, America, etcetera..
34	0		it was a credit card driven system charging 1Euro for 3 minutes online time and extra for every printed page.
6097	0		The room had a very swampy odour when the air conditioning was turned off.
3654	0		The mosquitos were not a problem either.
1890	0		and we had to cut our vacation short.
7066	0		Clean , tidy,very helpfull
741	0		So, no real sense of firm privacy is established.
2725	0		While they made some visible efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for,
1945	0		They charged us more than the quoted price,
6067	0		It became a joke that every day we had to go to Mary Jane to figure out what we were going to do and where we were going to eat
6207	0		I was a little nervous because my room was right across from the elevators but once I got into my room and saw how big it was and the layout of the room, I knew I wouldnt be bothered by hallway noise.
3400	0		The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures
1283	0		though so the room smelled fine.
3332	0		Reception was full of flowers, and an enduring memory of the hotel will be the scent of lilies, gorgeous
1213	0		but no one ever came to bring me the glass of water.
7471	0		The hotel is very clean but somewhat dingy.
5071	0		much better value that those of on La Rambla ?

6052	0		Room service was on the pricey side - two coffees were 11 Euro.
4355	0		We would have to drive there or they could call us a cab.
3103	0		When I got there it was about noon
1669	0		They don't realize the power of Trip adviser!
2685	0		Check in time was at 3:00 P.M. and we couldn't get into our room until 6:00 P.M. because "it wasn't ready."
7184	0		What was not so good is the fact that you cannot open the windows yourself, and they turned of the airco as it was getting cold outside.
5006	0		I did ask before hand to have a room in building #2 overlooking the pool.
3709	0		In the end, they helped me find another room for one night nearby ,at perhaps the worst hotel Ive stayed at in twenty years, and then gave me a room upgrade for the remaining night.
6538	1		But for a true represenation, go to the five star alliance website.
5039	0		The Marinium tour where you snorkel with sharks/stingrays.
4618	0		Mostly the sidewalks are being rebuilt.
5019	0		I always got my eggs or omleets prepared by the cook to ensure they were fresh.

6081	0		My ten year old wouldnt go in due to it being too full.
3869	0		Both check ins were smooth, staff lovely, room was great.
6301	0		The Gran Melia is world class.
5223	1		Also this is a safer area than say- Sol and the Gran Via-where I saw an attempt at pic-pocketing etc at night time.
7462	0		I strongly recommend to find another hotel rather than staying at the Belfort.
6921	0		My sixteen year old tech-savvy daughter and I spent 3 nights at the Diva while I was attending a conference at the Moscone Convention Center.
5700	0		Another guest was complaining about another issue at the same time, so it wasnt the best introduction.
1017	0		while before someone could see us,
1593	0		but we had to put up with where we were...
1768	0		Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view.
5716	0		Since the mayority of vacationers are from Spain, Portugal, Canadian and Argentinian to name a few, most of the food is guided toards them.
305	0		We tried the pool to relax ouserselves
1408	0		Very nice breakfast.
909	0		They could have done this at the begining instead of sending her on a hike of the backstreets of Berlin.
5102	0		While not on the beach, I think a lot of travellers put too much emphasis on needing to be beachfront in Waikiki.
1138	0		This room was facing the street
1209	0		and so I went down to the bar that is just off the main lobby and asked for a glass of water.
3159	0		but it was excellent.
2467	0		Stayed here for 2 nights.
4932	0		We felt as though we shouldnt be asking ANY questions....We would still recommend this hotel

7253	0		Loved the Majestic
2006	0		We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage
4996	0		Both are yummy.
1652	0		Now: I had been told to check in early
4013	0		We spent most of the day on the beach.
3474	0		The reservation system allowed only you to reserve for the current day or the day following.
2700	0		We paid extra for a "sweeping view of the city"
1389	0		My second stay at the Grosser Kurf��__rst was as enjoyable as the first, a year ago.
4866	0		That said, our upstairs neighbours also tried theirs and it leaked into our bathroom.
4122	0		The AC worked fine and the room was very clean.
2724	0		AND they lost the most important box of the lot.
60	0		but the rooms are poorly decorated, with common furniture.
1738	1		If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.
4786	0		They knew my name when I got out of the cab, which was wild, and the intro/check in/walk through was very cool indeed
6173	0		On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train ,fast and cheap,.
7439	0		We didnt ask for it, but got #442 which was tucked in the back with a nice view of Hollywood Blvds buildings.
4870	0		Beach Absolutely beautiful
6490	0		My son, another aquarian, referred to it as being steam cleaned.
2679	0		but didn't have a good experience at Cafe Campagne...
6202	0		The room was clean, laundry request was excellent but expensive.
1689	0		and the construction zone atmosphere down there was unpleasant.
4395	0		Its cold , clinical, joyless.
6166	0		The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in.
5943	0		The cuts of meat are different and they try very hard to have something for everyone.
892	0		Although it was there error, they actually still refused to move us,
641	0		That way you avoid the queues and walk right in like an expected guest- free tour excellent.
4132	0		The view and breeze from the ocean makes this place really awesome.
4076	0		There arent enough to go around
865	0		The rooms are spacious
7212	0		We stayed here from the 10th January for 3 nights and the last leg of our Honeymoon.
6572	0		The ocean-front corner room was nice, quiet, spacious and a very good value.
1148	0		and I found this an inherent problem with German Sofitels.
2322	0		The hotel itself is old,
6965	0		Also, anyone bothered by a really hard mattress would not enjoy this hotel.
4952	0		I wore earplugs but still had trouble getting any sleep.
2289	0		It is older but well kept,
1997	0		The coffee in the room of course was great (this being Seattle).

7436	0		Pluses: Theres a little market across the street that was well-stocked, lots of wine, chips, etc.
516	0		Short walks to K-damm, Savignyplatz, and zoo.
1181	0		This is normally a pay-to-see commercial attraction separate from the hotel,
2251	0		and we were all happy with the value for money and service.
1422	0		They do have a room for storing luggage
1727	0		I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help.
19	0		Having previously enjoyed a great week's stay at the sister art'otel in Berlin (the Warhol-themed City Centre West), we decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel so we could visit more of the sights on the eastern side of the city.
1780	0		Stayed here for 2 nights last week.
4897	0		Some of the people who were travelling with the same supplier were really negative ,one even complained about the wind being too loud and needing ear plugs,,
7276	0		SF - Excellent
2524	0		Not only would I never stay in this hotel again,
3111	0		My only complaint about the new tower is that the pool/spa/workout area is located on top of the OLD tower
3004	0		my last stay will likely be my last, despite the location, which is closest to my office.
2064	0		and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds.
1449	0		hotel was full and I got what I'd paid for, a single room.

5325	0		Hotel staff provided prompt and courteous service to address our every need.
3621	0		We came out from the game and our rentals window had been broken and everything we owned was stolen.
956	0		and some people who couldn't get a table ended up going away.
1184	0		Our stay entitled us to a bottle of champagne on arrival in the room,
1685	0		and fast--there were always at least 3 people at the front desk.
5584	0		This makes it easy for frequent stops during your day, to drop off shopping, etc.
5956	0		The we went inside and the manager didnt really care.
4641	0		The room was very noisy.
1977	0		Both of the rooms we were in were lavishly decorated, sparkling clean, with comfortable beds.
3218	0		however upon arrival the reservation was no where to be found.
4808	0		Trapped in Paradise
7271	0		The Bad: Front desk disorganized ,where do the lines begin??,

3948	0		Stayed here for a night with some friends for a wedding.
4375	0		Although most of the reviews of this hotel tell a fairly accurate picture- central, basic.
23	0		The hotel itself is already showing signs of age.
1474	0		but don't expect much in the way of character.
1534	0		but in the evenings these are pitch black.

437	0		and that there was to be no room there for our first night.
6752	0		and the waiter was great.
1940	1		However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise,
7390	0		Only down side was with the luxury breakfast - we had real problems getting a seat and juice.
862	0		The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Berlin Zoo, and maybe a fifteen minute walk to Postdamer Platz.

1671	1		There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you.
6715	0		The staff in my view is one of the best group of hotel employees in the world.

1935	0		and we had a nice time.
1846	0		Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either.
5035	0		The resort couldnt have been more than 50% full so there was always a shady spot to sit.
7453	0		Only a few minor issues - no shower curtain in the bathroom, the bed was a bit sunk in the middle, and our window faced another building.
6613	0		all these things, and many more, make it a relaxing haven to return to after a hot, busy days sightseeing, and all so conveniently close.
3795	0		For 168 quid two adults three nights B and B you cannot be robbed
6875	0		The service, whether being given by the front desk attendant, housekeeper, mini-bar refiller, bartenders, waiters/waitresses, managers, porters, security personnel, or towel attendants, is exceptional.

2927	0		Our room was clean,

4087	0		However, exceedingly frustrating was that the alla carte restaurants were never more than 35 percent full, that we saw, during any dinner time.
2658	0		The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.
4005	0		Not many loud drinking parties.
5499	0		I think the name was Central Market.
1117	0		and also that I had booked a cheapie.
3666	0		As expected Typical of this sort of hotel with rooms fitted and finished to a high standard, polite and attentive staff, good food, smart and spacious communal areas although these are beginning to look slightly dated now.
6582	0		OK Hotel was pretty centrally located - nice rooms, but air conditioning not controllable.
4608	0		There isnt much in the train station, but there is a Subway restaurant, some sort of coffee shop ,which may be attached to the Subway,, a small gift shop and both Amtrak and Greyhound ticket counters.
5929	0		Pool : Beautiful, well kept, lots of shade and the swim up bar was great.
578	0		I would not rate the hotel experience we had as 5 star, something on par with a 3 or 4 star but certainly not 5 star.
297	0		We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed.
5137	0		I had to flag down the hostess in order to get my check.
5153	0		Check in couldnt have been any smoother.
4564	0		We heard so many complaining during our stay and hope the took some time too to let them know.
2633	0		We were stuck there for over one hour after calling the hotel for assistance and having them tell use there was nothing they could do.
353	0		We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006.
2158	0		A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of saidremote-shrug of shoulders-our guests take them home you know set TV to CNN for duration of my stay.
6637	0		No way you can trust what you order is what you get.
1259	0		Not a 5 star hotel in any way.
6111	0		Staff were always pleasant and helpful.
3991	0		The wash basin was also located in the bedroom ,not in the bathroom, which struck me as odd and does not help matters when one person is an earlier riser than another.
3824	0		They also gave her some vouchers for a couple of free drinks
4272	0		What a DUMP... there are much better accomodations for the same price
3902	0		They really did a nice job each day on our room.
203	0		This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers
5192	0		Our room was a bay view - all fittings were excellent and my wife revelled in the bath.
773	0		but very clean and with a window that could open.
263	0		Breakfast is one of the best I ever had,
96	0		Almost everything in Germany had English translations, but not the machines there.
1905	1		Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor.
2042	0		The hotel itself was ok, fairly clean and decent location.
2817	0		I go to Seattle at least 4 or 5 times a year for pleasure.
4133	0		Also, they offer burgers and hot dogs for lunch for those who need their fix of junk food.
4042	1		So, if you ever have a bad experience at this hotel and they promise you something, you better get it in writing because Joanna Turmo will not come to the phone.
6082	0		We are the type to always make the best of a situation, so we did.
7440	0		We couldnt hear the traffic.
7048	0		The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot.
106	0		although a call to housekeeping solved this problem.
6741	0		The room was lovely; not as big or as posh as pictured, but I also hadnt reserved a suite.
5537	0		We felt sorry for them.
2666	0		it felt similar to the W (another Starwood hotel) but larger.
5021	0		Lunch at the Beach buffet was OK.
7255	0		After reading the reviews everyday up until the time I left, I was very nervous about staying here.
6642	0		Instead, they push very expensive courses requiring extra transportation costs.
3168	0		This was my 3rd long stay at the hotel,
3201	0		and the management seemed to be hiding out in some alcove behind the desk.
7074	0		Well, all we saw of the ocean was the roof top of another building.
7136	0		It is on the second floor of a building and really is in great walking distance to the markets, ice cream stores, restaurants, the duomo, uffizi, and the accademia.
4257	0		The only little complaint I had was that the room was a corner ,#827, and the left and front were all windows so the TV was actually to the right of the bed which made watching in bed difficult.
863	0		The hotel lobby has recently been renovated.
1341	0		But because of the constant spilling of water from handwashing etc, the wood was now cracking up and appearing very worn.
4031	0		Most of the drinks were rum drinks, but you could get other types of drinks on request.
6661	0		Its a 5 minute walk from union square and getting on trolleys etc, near some bars and restaurants and the staff are really helpful and really friendly.
5543	0		we often were brought courses twice because of the lack of communication.
2242	0		We had refurbished room which was clean, huge and very comfortable.
6556	0		Everyone we encountered during our four day stay was attentive, friendly, welcoming, and extremely professional.
1678	0		and they even had a free shuttle to downtown which we only used on our first night becuase we soon realised just how close we really were to everything.
3264	0		Like others before, i agree that the lift took ages to arrive at times, which was mildly frustrating.
2166	0		Was almost sorry to leave-or was it teh thought of another Monday at the office looming large ?
3499	0		I am sure that our complaint is not the only one they will receive about the problems at the Gran Flamenco, Punta Cana as there were many unsatisfied guests there.
3854	0		After I saw where the Crowne Plaza and Marriott was located, I was glad I won the Red Leeow bid, since we like being in the center of touristy things and this was it.
1026	0		the only saviour was the ARTOTEL across the street which had a nice bar
6722	0		The location is ideal, two minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia and the Linea 5 metro station.
7459	0		you can buy drinks from outside the hotel for l.60 euro. bed sheets were never changed during that week and room was never cleaned.
2185	0		Neighbourhood is dicey, but so is the whole of this area, no unpleasant encounters, though many homeless people.
266	0		The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it.
6719	0		This is exactly what a dream hotel stay should be.
1501	0		Indeed, what irked the most was that the room was full of overpriced bottles of mineral water that they could have offered to guests during this time to use.
6181	0		Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping.
1575	0		no chance for me I'm afraid, the traffic noise was just to great, even with plugs!!
5992	0		It is a great location - close to North Beach, Union Square and Chinatown.
3814	0		I called, and spoke with Matthew Sims once again just to be laughed at and told to have a nice day.
1343	0		On the other hand, this inflexible halfwall must be a major obstacle for the room ladies when they're cleaning the upper part of the tub.
5302	1		If you can, upgrade to an Ocean Front Room
3202	0		Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience,
4457	0		I never saw anyone walking around picking up garbage either.
2311	0		The hotel is very close to Pike's Place Market.
6112	0		Bar prices very good.
4713	0		Everything is cooked well��_��__ it tastes like American food.
6798	0		Just try it
2928	0		nice and the staff was very friendly.
2912	0		The other motel like feature were thin and rough towels.
4752	1		Dont let the price fool you- its better to spend a few extra bucks for cleanliness, a walkable neighborhood without someone asking you for money or cigarettes or whatever they may be looking for.
770	0		As far as location, this was a nice neighborhood and convenient to the subway, restaurants, shopping, etc. I was a female traveling alone,
4438	0		The dessert that is served is the same ones that come from the main buffet.
1582	0		YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE ONE!!!!"
5506	0		They acussed me and some friends of taking something from the minibar - they acussed us of lying.
919	0		Stayed there for 2 nights at December 2004.
1127	0		and we were offered free cocktails.
7219	0		We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, theres nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar.
79	0		We turned the cushions over.
5573	0		The result: employees who are exhausted and dont care.
6991	0		Sand fleas or ants in room, which I am not a beach person so didnt know if this was normal or not???
5673	0		The rooms were above average for NYC and the were very clean.
7410	0		NOW, today I received my credit card bill and found that this place falsely charged my credit card for a stay
3140	0		The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all.
3322	0		We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by.
1406	0		Really good location.
6883	1		Please remember to tip the staff.
4260	0		The bed was very comfortable and the even with the 2 walls of glass, the room darkeners kept in pitch black.
2067	0		There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel.
3857	1		Remember to buy water from the supermarket near Madame Tussauds, much cheaper than anywhere else.
1525	0		you have to get on a bus which will take you to a station on the U-Bahn so we ended up catching a taxi to the hotel instead which came to about 25 Euro's which is cheaper than most taxi's to other European cities we have been to.
2919	0		and the bathroom was alright.
2003	0		When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello.
3730	0		There is a wine bar called Nabucca on Via XXVII April, which had a nice spread of appetizers, complimentary with drinks.
5258	0		But we did not have one bad meal.
4441	0		The food was simple but really good.
3102	0		I used Priceline Name your own price and got a room for a 2 night stay for $101 a night.
6344	0		This surprised me since Ohana has some completely non smoking properties.
2825	0		It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton.
6614	0		Just one thing - do not be put off by the rather dark street entrance.
579	0		We stayed at this hotel because it was near to K'damn
2397	0		Location was very central
974	0		The tour bus goes from the end of the street and is close to Zoo Station.
7200	1		For a good breakfast right on the beach check out Dukes ,less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel,.
4556	0		Excellent bartenders.
4312	0		We learned this the hard way, after dining there- Front Desk Staff should have told us of this exclusion on day one but forgot ,?,.
7252	0		I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.
4674	0		When I saw that on the bar menu the second night, I asked the bartender.
429	0		Is this the Hilton?
4148	0		The room was massive, and the bathroom was incredible
2832	0		I gave up.
1759	0		Negatives: Decor is very plain, nothing special, worn out.

6119	0		It was the perfect location for shopping,too.
1220	0		Oh, and on check out, they had charged me for the bottled water that they did not bring me, so of course, I protested , and they reluctantly took it off of my bill.
5189	0		Very refined Got a great deal on the internet ,40% off advertised rates, and used it as a one night stopover en route back to Heathrow.
2164	0		I nod off into a fitful sleep.

2325	0		I was pleased with the staff,
4329	0		When we complained she said you were outside for about 5 minutes basically called us liars.
1659	0		and they sold my room.
4902	0		Obviously, itll take more than two months to get to the four star level.
130	0		When we changed to a renovated room were were delighted with the bathroom
4077	0		The more frustrating kink was the hotels dinner reservation system.
1804	1		If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.
4109	0		They rate this resort as a 5 star, and it truly is.
2909	0		However, under the duvet was a traditional old blanket.
2779	0		They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay.
6144	0		The queen sized bed on one wall with a small desk on one side and a small nightstand on the other.

4030	0		We liked the Japenese and the Steakhouse the best.
228	0		A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds.
4823	0		The hotel staff that peddled excursions harassed you in the hotel, on the grounds and on the beach constantly.
4084	0		At first, we were worried, since we were not impressed by the large buffet at the Grand Palladium.
1818	0		He gave us directions  even advised us on portion sizes.
5360	0		On the same street two or three miles past nice office parks to the west are all sorts of great restaurants.
5685	0		It was beautiful
4963	0		The reception staff and cleaners were really friendly and helpful, all spoke excellent English which was helpful as our Catalan was pitiful.
5965	0		We called downstairs and they replied Sorry.
6278	0		We have just returned from six nights at the New York Sofitel.
1687	0		They also have a business center with 2 computers with internet access and a printer (free use of all when I was there).
4865	0		My bf tried the tub, which he very much enjoyed.
2421	0		and the toilet was FILTHY!
5687	0		The bathroom was small, but the kitchenette and large living room more than made up for it.
5507	0		In the few hours we were there we didnt even see there was a minibar.
4183	0		These are old time diners which have become famous for their food.
6279	0		Whilst this is our first Tripadvisor report - our opinion of the Sofitel is based on comparison with a variety of Hotels across four continents.
6521	0		Did not go to the Cellar bar, but clearly it attracts quite a crowd.
7428	0		We were able to find seating without issue.
2756	0		Rooms are very small.
6007	0		This Hotel is located just two blocks from the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle.
1842	0		Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise.
7071	0		After an easy flight from JFK we had to wait for over 35 minutes for the hotel bus to pick us up and bring us to the hotel.
5817	0		Next time I visit NYC I will definitley be staying here again.
7412	0		This isnt some one time accident.
4039	0		She offered to, take care of my parking during my stay.
5455	0		The mini bar is included.
5660	0		We will be staying at the Windsor Court every time we return to New Orleans.

3799	0		It was a normal sized regular room with a pull down bed with a small divider in the middle of the beds.
5875	0		the owners are very nice people and will call cabs for you, make suggestions, and fill other reasonable requests.
4945	0		Even the bathroom sparkled.

7157	0		We all did take a soak in that huge tub, though.
6988	0		Only problem was with room service close to closing time of restaurant.
6115	0		This hotel will definetly be my choice of hotel when we plan our next visit to Amsterdam.
1987	0		It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests.
117	1		If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.
4848	0		The location is simply perfect and the staff must be among the friendliest and most helpful we have ever come across.
2941	0		Location is great...there is a cheesecake factory right near the hotel,
7521	0		A Wonderful Resort GRAN BRAHIA

931	0		The room given to us was on the first floor.
2347	0		When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere.
871	0		We decided to book an extra night online and arrive on a Wednesday.
561	0		The location is great.
5654	1		Room layout good - but would recommend some barrier to stop water from the shower getting the carpet wet
2270	0		I've stayed there four times over the past two or three years and every time I've been,
6454	0		My wife and i stayed at the Astor Crowne Plaza in August 2007 for 2 nights.
471	0		Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service.
2100	0		We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite.
5520	0		My main gripe is that when you are paying $300 a night for a room you would expect to have free internet in your room.
6777	0		Every employee we encountered at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.
3695	0		The hallways smelled a little funky, but tolerable.
121	0		and the hotel served its purpose.
3236	0		The rooms were quite nice and clean.
2598	0		In fact, we had to walk to all of our destinations because the Taxi's
2914	0		and wired internet was $10.
7235	0		Very large bathroom and lots of hot water and pressure in the morning.
1016	0		and even after me asking if I could speak with somebody else and being TOLD to take a seat in the bar as it would take a

3571	0		The food was expensive in the hotel.
6444	0		We stayed with a park n fly rate.
6820	0		The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasnt bad at all.
3670	0		Barcelona over the net.
7350	0		The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.
5201	0		There are 2 beaches nearby ,10-15min walk, Dukes opposite the Hilton and the lovely Ala Moana beach park on the other side of the Marina.
3258	0		Well, it didnt let us down.
3851	0		Turns out that was not what the hotel offered.
2522	0		I also left a telephone message for him
747	0		What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street.
2517	0		I became aware at check out that they had charged my credit card.
879	0		the only instruction given was to turn right outside door and straight down.
110	0		and it was disappointing to end our trip in a place that was so sterile and impersonal.
6254	0		I want to mention specially the attention af the personell, specially Dilcia, Janet, Heidy and Donald at the front desk.
5862	0		But it is a 4* hotel ,by international standards, and is is MUCH better then any hotel you can find in the city centre in that price range.
6872	0		No matter where you are in the pool there is a bar close-by, not to mention the swim-up bar.
1401	0		I got a much better deal at the Marriott Potsdamer Platz on a previous trip.
5915	0		Its also become kind of a fun joke that we still mention.
4283	0		The hotel is a small boutique hotel that has been recently modernised.
3208	0		The rooms were clean and well maintained.
7393	0		I soon discovered things were a bit different.
3646	0		I liked that wine and soft drinks were available with honesty payments and a fridge to store your own purchases but felt it was a lack that there was no coffee or tea-making facilities either in room or in area where could have lunch.
2612	0		Quite expensive and service was mediocre.
751	0		Plus they are open to 11, perfect after a long day and big dinner.
966	0		2004 2005.
3776	0		It is well located, near Union Square with lots of shops and restaurants nearby.
3953	0		Unless you are into travel nightmares.
6595	0		The cafe had opened downstairs so we were able to grab something light and easy for breaky.
7042	0		,3, the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free.
6371	0		You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window.
4628	0		I checked and double checked, and called Marriotts Platinum desk and asked them to verify that no mention was made.
6584	0		Room was ok, but I couldnt change the controls.
1177	0		and departures gates until you are ready to fly as there is Nothing on the other side of security, just gates and seats.
6485	0		Very trendy, but warm and inviting at the same time.
2094	0		Rooms are very basic to say the least,
7025	0		I would definitely go back.
6529	0		New York is a veritable smorgasbord of hotels ranging from sleezy to sublime.
634	1		Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings!
2810	0		Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant.
4872	0		There were also plenty of chairs for everyone.
4363	0		We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat.
2487	0		The hotel has a new updated tower (no high floors) and lost it's parking space-thus now only offers expensive valet parking at 35.00 +tax.
6475	0		If youre picking between this and something a little cheaper, this is WELL worth what we spent...well go back
3615	0		Kind and Considerate
5238	0		Travelled with three children
2795	0		but we found the hotel very quiet for its size
3498	0		However, what should have been the best part of our vacation the time in Punta Cana fell far short of our expectations, because of the inferior food service and inadequate service at the beach.
3242	0		Perfect hotel at a perfect location
2320	0		I went to the Moore with a few co-workers as a getaway to see Seattle's sights.
4584	0		And the price was very reasonable, considering the quality of the place.
348	0		As a Gold HHonors member, we received an upgraded room, which was very quiet, comfortable, and large, but had no view (windows open to an inner courtyard).
135	0		3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.
1910	0		No Space Needle, no view.
5277	0		The hotel staff was pleasant and extremely helpful.
3497	0		The transfers worked smoothly and our accommodation in Vancouver was just as advertised.
5123	0		The iPod-dockable clock radio was on and softly playing some classical music.
2265	0		but the Moore had nothing.
5551	0		I kid you not.
3085	0		The hotel was very empty
635	0		I doubt they have the capacity at that time to run a bath, never mind an airline -with hundreds of passengers wanting to go home and not wanting to wait as long as the flight time from berlin to get to the car park.
1979	0		The Warwick is within walking distance of most, if not all, of the tourist attractions Seattle has to offer.
4793	0		But this place delivers for all intents and purposes, no doubt.
6192	0		It is possible to walk to the nearest station but it will not be that comfortable if you have luggage with you.
7289	0		Gorgeous beach, beautiful resort *Readers be aware:
7215	0		For a hotel which is aspiring to great things this attitude is something fundamental which needs to be addressed.
4596	0		Like dating a supermodel...
6113	0		Little terrace was lovely for sitting and relaxing.
6363	0		Nice Base for Exploring
828	0		It's clean and the beds are good.
3547	0		Restaurants and bars Very good from bar snacks, to the chinese ,Ming Court I think?,
4648	0		The sole person who convinced me to not leave was one of the security guards.
7058	0		Good vacation for the money.
1048	0		while i took my (occasionally cold) shower.
5482	0		Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel.
5047	0		I was surprised as one morning there was a wedding by the pool and the day before I saw a wedding too.
335	0		I haven't stayed at too many nicer hotels.
6310	0		Wages are the same, and cost of living is very high here unlike most destinations in the Carribean, so dont expect to come here and rack up on some over priced brand name purses, because everything is priced basically the same as in the states.

2916	0		I was expecting something nice
453	0		Is a remodel in the future?
2667	0		The staff was more mature  friendlier than the W. There's ample seating in the lobby to read the newspaper, an area of computers for guests, a takeout cafe/bakery and a restaurant/grill...from what I saw.

2856	0		Even thought I secured what I felt was a very reasonable rate on Hotwire I do not feel the hotel was worth the price.

5733	0		The hotel has maximum 6 floors.
4859	0		We were quite surprised since we hadnt made any special requests and were just supposed to get a standard room.

3261	0		We were suprised by the 42 flat screen tv on the wall when we opened the door.
4505	0		Staff neither gushing nor aloof.
7360	0		I have to say its amenities and services were great.
993	0		The decor is very early 80s with some nauseating bright green everywhere...
930	0		When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.

2317	0		The hotel staff was young and knowledgeable.
5888	0		Comfortable bed with fresh sheets everyday.

6299	0		Let me start by saying Im a 30 year old guy and Im not one of these people that have never traveled before and then come straight home to write a review about how wonderful there vacation was, because lets face it, first time in the Carribean, how could it be bad?
7230	0		After dinner we returned to the Marriott for coffee and dessert.
161	0		We were moved to a slightly better double room (two beds purshed together) but still in the old part of the hotel.
7513	0		Room and bathroom were quite large for European standards.
3172	0		And the beds are amazingly comfortable: fine cotton sheets and soft down duvets and pillow made for a relaxing sleep.
3605	0		WAYYY better than my runny eggs and 4EUro Coke at the hotel.
1985	0		then looked at the parents as if it was their fault.
315	0		This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...
7238	0		Security is also very evident and appreciated.

6005	0		We loved our stay
3096	0		It was our first time in Seattle
5044	0		Lovely Small Hotel
5177	0		We asked at front desk and then said they would send someone up in 10 minutes, over 1 hour later no sign so we asked to move rooms.

7484	0		Great location and breakfast
2531	0		Once we arrived to the hotel,
3891	0		The staff was friendly and helpful, especially at the concierge desk.
3793	0		It is an ideally located hotel as we got off great airport express to Alexanderplatz, came out the station at the foot of the hotel.
231	0		No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here.
665	0		The beds are rather hard.
1254	0		The hotel staff was generally unhelpful.
4656	0		Not likely any time soon.
3347	0		Staff was friendly and hard-working - yes, many are from other European countries, but all work hard and are very friendly, so I cant see why some reviewers ,and even some hotel-guests we overheard, would mention it as if it was a negative
6726	0		The suites were spotlessly clean, modern and fully equipped with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen with some utensils.
4824	0		Once they realized that we were from America the price tripled for an average three hour excursion.

5446	0		Elevator didnt appear to work.

2882	0		and she did apologize
4619	0		I didnt have a problem with the construction in the city and I came down mainly because NOLa needs support.
2864	0		Concierge: Very helpful The bads:Elevators: -- not enough and very slowCoffee shop: -- ridiculously expensive.
4851	0		We looked around at some alternatives but we reckon this is the best value hotel on the beach front and cannot recommend it highly enough.
4545	0		Sofas in room were dirty and damaged.
3065	0		they were unable to accommodate us with a room in the newly refurbished section of the hotel unless we chose a room with only double beds.

3281	0		Thanks to all staff.
4673	0		The turkey club was good, albeit served just on run-of-the-mill white bread, not the advertised sourdough.
690	0		though I did find the concierge to be particularly unhelpful.
2545	0		and new tower were no longer a construction zone,
1447	0		So no closet, no chest of draws and a room the size of a phonebox.
1007	0		and the receptionist simply looked up the reservation in her system, pointed to the crossroads and informed us that the hotel we were staying in was around the corner and four minutes away.
2	0		Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker,
5844	0		My husband and two children ages 8 and 5 all loved our stay at the Ritz Carlton.
2651	0		For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking.

2849	0		and I was directed to the wrong set.

6334	0		We had the front desk call a cab for us on our way out to dinner and were offered the hotel car and driver for our return.
3942	0		They also only dumped the garbage, they did not replace the lining.
2813	0		Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget.
5684	0		Suite available so we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite.
3986	0		While not bad, it certainly lacks many of the finer qualities of the areas better establishments ,Four Seasons, Phoenician, Fairmont Scottsdale Princess,.
295	0		and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it.
5883	0		This hotel aint cheap, but it is in the middle of a very touristy area.

1282	0		The smell never made it pass the lobby
1056	0		Just returned from a fortnight in Berlin staying at the Steigenberger.
1907	0		and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located.
2314	0		Our room even had a fairly big closet.
6919	0		We would go back in an instant, worth the few extra bucks.
6879	0		They might have spoken to my sister and I more than others because we speak really good Spanish and this would pique their interest as to where we learned to speak the language.
4956	0		How can you go back to the ranch when you been to Paris, or to be exact the George V Four Seasons Hotel.
2734	0		Will not repeat this hotel, and frankly hurt my impression of Sheraton overall as well.

1291	0		but in a 5* hotel I expected one to be there.
7068	0		This was a pleasant ,safe ,place to stay where the parking was free and yet short walk to Canairie Wharf/cable cars.
856	0		id defo say a good hotel for the money,
1086	0		there was one pump in the shower that was a body and/or shampoo.
4173	0		We stayed only 1 night after a cruise with Carnival.
750	0		On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves.
793	0		it all seems to happen right next to you.
1854	0		and unfortunately Warwick Seattle Hotel was the only dissapointment through our trip.
1746	0		And in Seattle of all places!
5073	0		Found one bar just down the street taking a right out of the hotel which was a good night and one lovely one set in the walled garden area found by walking out of the hotel taking a left and left again and there is a large wall opposite
3804	0		Imagine the anger.
2730	0		there is nothing here that special,
1867	0		while we were watching TV loudly.
4638	0		Then, the display returns the number/letter of the car which will take you to your floor.
4659	0		Others may love it.
78	0		Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.
5717	0		Now, I am not by any means saying that the food is bad, the food is very well prepared but I did not like most of their food because I am not use to eating European style food.
5809	0		To our surprise they upgraded us the a bigger room.
1686	0		The lobby also has a nice lounge area with a fireplace.
984	0		and the room I was given had a single bed (I haven't seen this in hotels for years!) and was smaller than most student accommodation I have seen!
5179	0		Told us about a vegaterian restruant that had closed down years ago, a dry cleaners that was also shut.
1616	1		for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service.
2466	0		but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.
3175	0		The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away.
5326	0		The interior decor reflected modern style and charm with four-star comfort.
2411	0		They can be seen in the attached photos.
6971	0		With all this said, we did have a good time.
2206	0		(and I'm not even a squeamish person)!
9	0		But the rooms are small and not very functional.
844	0		This hotel is also dog-friendly,
5060	0		My husband and myself enjoyed this wonderful resort from July 19 thru July 28th.
547	1		I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.
3623	0		We finally arrived around 2 AM as the police never came to the scene.
7494	0		Subway is 2 blocks away.
379	0		Dinner at Trader Vics _��_ Again OK, it was nothing to write home about.
2557	0		On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the room, strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room.
3778	0		There is free wireless Internet access in the rooms and another nice touch is the free glass of wine served between 5 and 6 - this ensures the guests gravitate to the lounge and creates a warm, friendly atmosphere.
413	0		Hotel amenities were excellent.
6592	0		None of the other facilites were opened but it didnt matter because you have everything you needed within walking distance.
949	0		We complained to management three times
3411	0		The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound.
1275	0		The have a large variety of food which was great
2083	0		We found the hotel to be a great location to everything that downtown Seattle has to offer.
2614	0		Only problem is that the Factory doesn't open for breakfast.
1041	0		but the workings underneath are old.
6431	0		A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket ,along with a few drinks that were for sale, and was also meant to be used as a work space.
6830	0		This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.
7383	0		However, the best part is the care you receive from Fabrizio and Tommaso from the moment you book the reservation and ask for touring help, to check in and out, to dinner and musuem reservations while you are there.
6342	0		This is initially why I booked with them.
6604	0		After reading all of the negative reviews, I took a chance anyway and was very pleased.
6233	0		On Sat. nights during the summer, they show Dive-in movies at 7:30 p.m - you can watch the movie while in the pool or sit on the deck chairs, complete with popcorn.
2760	0		We stayed in the Union Street tower (new standard king room) and found it to be very nice!!
2312	0		We went every day.
5398	0		Exterior of hotel is very old and dated...I was worried when we drove up to check in.
4688	0		Frankly I still dont know what they were saying, aside from implying that I am an idiot.
4262	1		The location is perfect and I highly recommend the spa at the attached LA sports Club.
1554	0		We paid just ���149.
5086	0		A Fine Establishment
5770	0		No apology, no offer of upgrade, no sort of compensation.
3797	0		First and formost this hotel is a nice property, how ever the rooms are not at all as they tell on the website.
2249	0		and it was pleasantly furnished, clean and comfortable.
7321	0		Only a short walk from Time Sq and Central Perk ,ha,.
1969	0		When I made the reservations, I told the hotel that we would have a late arrival but please save a room on the higher floors with a view for us, as we would be there 2 nights.
2328	1		Make no mistake - the Moore is pretty much a dump.
5792	0		Check -in was fine, as there was 14 of us it took a while but no longer than youd expect, plus we were all upgraded from standard to deluxe rooms.
6652	1		Ask for room not facing street.
2097	0		The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable.
2544	0		I can say that I was happy to see that the lobby
7144	0		It is a three star hotel.
3022	0		but that just seemed like a mission since we only had one full day in Seattle at the tail end of this trip.
5321	0		A t-shirt and a bottle just dont cut it when you spent so much to come and relax
6569	0		There are some very good things about The Marseilles, #1 being its perfect location.
3209	0		The staff was the best.
220	0		The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel.
3225	0		The breakfasts are great - fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, hot eggs and sausage, etc.
1465	0		I would trade the breakfast off for the location which again is excellent.
1149	0		They are not up to the international standards.
5219	0		Madrid is fabulous and I hope to return when the weather is warmer.
614	0		and sauna area- they are dangerous.
2900	0		You won't be disappointed.
4971	1		If you have time take the morning trek with lunch.
7247	0		I first stayed at the Hotel Metro about 8 years ago and over the years have returned when visiting NY either for business or pleasure.
7018	0		Ala cartes as well at buffets.
4827	0		What I had a problem with was the rooms had thin walls.
4854	0		I had read many complaints on this site, and though I saw many negative ones, I figured no matter what I would keep a positive outlook.
1506	0		The hotel is OK for leisure travellers but not particularly useful for business travellers.
4796	1		Abit impersonal though, so if you are looking for a place remembering your name Conrad isnt the first place to look, on most important points it clearly delivers.
4090	0		you are supposed to be dining there, to be very frustrating.
1441	0		I booked a single room - big mistake.
7081	0		It appears there is one main kitchen.
4234	1		If you are looking for a few nice dinner restaurants, we loved Legal Seafood , at the Wharf, and Plaza III Kansas City Steakhouse , at Fanueil Hall/South Market,.
3637	0		Breakfast lackluster.
6237	0		We will definitley stay here again.
5751	1		A must if you have an unlimited expense account since the rooms are very expensive but certainly worthwhile
6252	0		I stayed there on business for 4 nights in early June.
982	0		Also, getting taxis from hotel never took more than 3 minutes when the hotel called, which was rather impressive.
4850	0		The desk staff are great but if you need anything special ask for Leonor who will go out of her way to get what you need.
4810	0		My husband and I received a gift to go for our honeymoon.
4358	0		We did not bring our laptop and the Copamarnia does not have any available computers, so we did not have a way to do any online research.
4685	0		Most of the people I encountered outside of the hotel were very nice.
5079	0		Found the staff helpful and the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was, so no trouble finding it.

3768	0		Dare I say Perfect?
939	0		As for the bathroom well what can we say.

3489	0		During our stay, despite many requests we were never able to persuade the staff to put a sailboat in the water.
5627	0		I must give them credit at least they left the mirror on my windshield, so I guess they werent thieves, just vandals.

3125	0		and in-room internet was $11 a day.

4372	1		However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice.
1135	0		The room was small
1811	0		and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel.
6298	0		Absolutely Beautiful
17	1		and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived.

6689	0		The staff was helpful, friendly, and well-informed about the area.
1113	0		and when I produced my bit of paper that clearly said kingsize bed,
1045	0		it was a sign i should have checked out immediately - at one point there wasn't even hot water in the hotel for over an hour.
7146	0		Among the best, for sure
2616	0		There really aren't too many simple places to eat in the near vicinity unless you go to the food courts in one of the shopping centers nearby.
5968	0		Needless to say, I will not return.
2228	0		Perfect.
1075	0		but seemly our room did not have.

3330	0		The reception staff and all the waiting/bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
7423	0		Room: Very clean, still had a newly built smell and feel to it, which was nice.

6096	0		If I had known what we would get, I would have asked for a room with a large window.

972	0		We got great deals on both occasions, and could not complain for the price.
2036	0		and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window.
125	0		but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed.

2035	0		It was slightly cool outside
1490	0		our luggage just stayed in the lobby

3135	0		It is in need of a serious upgrade.
443	0		The staff and in particular, Doreen the acting front desk manager were all superb
3398	0		This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up.
608	0		bathrooms are really nice marble and glass.
4880	0		I also enjoyed the Japanese where the cook prepared the food in front of you and does a little show off routine.
1410	0		although this would only be a problem in the summer.
1556	0		and therefore the review has to be put into that kind of perspective.

2851	0		The room was clean and standard but outdated in shades of buff and yellow.
4380	0		We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit.
2663	0		I chose it because of the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor,
3195	0		Walking to nearly every sight in Seattle was a breeze.
7526	0		Pools- Three large pools that everyone can use, one for the upgraded travellers.
5672	0		Stayed at the Hilton Times Square 5 nights for a business event.
1655	0		To say that I have a room locked in and then to DOWN GRADE me, is inexcusable.
3524	0		More historical and cultural sites are within walking distance than we could possibly see in our 5 day stay.
4029	1		Choose to go to the specialty resturants on other nights.
6083	0		We had an enjoyable stay, it wasnt terrible, but I wouldnt be inclined to stay at that hotel again.
4891	0		Awesome coffee shop you have to try too.
2576	0		I travel 3 of 4 weeks a month and found this property to be less than satisfactory
5979	0		However on the minus side lighting in room at night was dim and bedside lights were a strain to read by, which we like to do.
2045	0		I am glad I got a discount.
1491	0		and anyone can open it or take it.
3560	0		Flights Virgin ,Direct booking, Truly Rubbish service both ways and I like Virgin.

4524	0		Our room was an oceanview standard with King bed on the 12th floor.

952	0		and despite telling the cleaner it was still not changed.
7292	0		The weather, the tropical landscaping, and best of all the beach, rank above the others for a winter getaway.
2615	1		My suggestion would be to have a donut and coffee for breakfast, you're in Seattle after all!
3129	0		and I would be happy to stay there again.
3667	0		Location was not ideal although in any big city no location is ideal for everywhere anyway.
7481	0		You can let in outdoor noise or block it out with their windows.
5172	0		I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.
1516	0		The rooms were big enough, clean and very confortable,
2338	0		Receptionists are friendly and Internet access is a big plus point,
3704	0		A nice place and I would probably stay there again.
3156	0		It is billed as being a small luxury hotel but really didn't see it as being any different other than decor.
2768	0		And yup, parking is expensive everywhere in SEA.
3227	0		Just around the corner from the hotel is a FABULOUS little Italian restaurant - Bon Amici.
3556	0		I have no qualms about staying Kowloon side the hotels tend to be cheaper.
2579	0		The beds are short sheeted which causes the bed to unravel
1384	0		When I mentioned my knee surgery (cane was the tip-off), they made a big show of reluctantly upgarding me to a double on another floor.

7470	0		We stayed in the economy size room which was VERY small but I knew to expect that as the hotel makes that clear.
385	0		Overall _��_ This is a typical businessman_��_s / conference hotel.
7368	0		When we arrived, we climbed the flight of stairs with 100 plus lbs of luggage.
1225	0		I've now resolved the issue and am just hoping that my actual stay will prove less stressful than the reservations process.

2422	0		I will spare you the details,

1642	1		Just hope that you get there to get a room ahead of someone else!
3458	0		An experience of a lifetime
7473	0		As far as the bathroom and sheets everything is perfectly clean.
3964	0		The hotel is located about 15-20 minutes from central Hollywood, and is right in the center of Beverly Hills, on Beverwil Drive.
600	0		The time was well invested
589	0		Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).
1914	0		The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed.
6425	0		I stayed at the Union Square Hotel for 2 nights in October 2006.
941	0		The frame of the shower was also falling to pieces and came off in your hand when you closed the door.
6948	0		We stayed at the Royal Hawaiian for two weeks in January 2005 and loved it.
4531	0		No welcome drink or greeting upon arrival.
5528	0		We had problems and at first thought it was just us.
6023	0		The woman at the front desk didnt even greet us with a hello to us when we came into the front office...something you would expect if everyone proclaims they are friendly.
2801	0		My husband and I work for a luxury hotel company so,
4228	0		We used this as our main transportation for the first two days and we saw basically everything without getting too overwhelmed.
7	0		Yes, the public spaces are nicely designed,
2639	0		and the furniture was beautiful and well-made,
4478	0		Breakfast is a buffet continental repast-- the room gets crowded but the food is quite fresh.
5100	0		Theres a complimentary breakfast, and I was able to use a courtesy room to shower before my flight.
6416	0		This place is away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu.
961	0		In fact the room was used to store suitcases for people checking out of their rooms.
5472	0		The one which decreased the value of this hotel is that the lobby is up a flight of stairs.
4159	0		No complaints, hotel served its purpose admirably.
4699	0		We had a Luxury Jacuzzi Gardenview Ste.....The best room ever.
1531	0		We got a room on the first floor, used the 2 lifts initially which look more like detention cells, walked through the dark and very green hallway to our room.
6765	0		The room had two double beds with lovely bedspreads, nice sheets and great pillows.
766	0		you can order something and go down to pick it up and take back to your room.
960	0		but no one was told if this room was an extra room for breakfast.
6247	1		Bigger rooms , bar at ground floor, bigger reception, but then it wouldnt be the hotel that it is .
7056	1		Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, dont carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, dont let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door.
3741	0		On the good side :No People tresspassing past your door when you eventually get back ,My Room,.
3051	0		while my husband was attending a convention we upgraded to a club room with a desk.
5252	0		You have to rent the games though.
4045	0		There is a lot of high tech inside the room but some is just too high tech and not useful and even dangerous.
3178	1		Would definitely recommend the hotel: we stayed a couple of nights at the W Seattle
3925	0		She left a roll of gabage bags on the bathroom sink, I guess that was for me to do.Overall, I did not care for the service that I recieved.
5583	0		What a scam.
4324	0		The downstairs bar looked really nice.
1305	0		There was no bidet in the bathroom which had an awkward toilet cut-off door arrangement
7449	0		Location is convenient - Monoprix grocery/ drugstore is nearby, its a 15-20 minute walk to Opera Garnier and the department stores, 20-30 minute walk to the Champs Elysees.
3158	0		We only had breakfast at Lola (the adjoining restaurant)
1253	0		The lack of a pillow service is remarkable for a 5 star hotel.
4126	0		We ate mostly at the buffet.
2932	0		the cardio room was nice
5243	0		We just said WOW.
4238	0		It is all over the city and you will defintely catch the fever
4751	0		The neighborhood was marginal��_��__ must not be far from a landfill- the stink was terrible
4181	0		We ate at Cafe du Monde, Johnny Poboys, and Mothers.
7194	1		I would highly recommend an upgrade for that price.
6978	0		Minimalist modern rooms; motorized blinds, glass bathroom, flat screen TV.
5787	1		Walking to the shops, you may want to mentally prepare yourself for the abuse you will take from the local shop owners,aka vultures, that will swoop down upon you to practically drag you into their shops.
6029	1		Weve stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area.
2505	0		but it was stone cold.
4003	0		The grounds were beatiful and at night the ground lighting created a romantic effect in the landscaping.
6622	0		Tucked into a quiet neighborhood, the 10 minute walk to and from the hotel each day through the gorgeous Vondel Park provided us with a very scenic and peaceful way to begin and end each of our days.
6527	0		My biggest client owns one of the largest chains in the world.
2935	0		Can't wait to go back !!!!
4508	1		Note pedestrian area of the Rambla means in the evening taxis cannot approach and a walk may be required.
2198	0		Mike said he'd help us out with the bill and find us another room so we decided to stay.
1139	0		and it was HOT, not just warm but VERY HOT.
3424	0		I did not notice traffic sounds during our stay, but I also sleep like the dead so it no surprise.
7435	0		Though, thatd be a nice touch.
6553	0		Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queens Beach ,just two blocks from the hotel to the South,.
1419	0		Depressing and not to be recommended.
5811	0		It had a full Kitchen, dining room area, bedroom with 2 beds and pull out couch.
962	0		It was not locked so anyone could walk in.
5794	0		The location was excellent, 5min cab journey to Las Ramblas, which was approx 6-7 euros.
267	0		Overall the hotel is quite ok,
4871	0		It was a bit small compared to other resorts Ive stayed at in Cuba and Mexico, but the water was pristine.
4388	0		The hotel is located near Outram Park.
7492	0		There was a small roof top pool which we did not use.
4266	0		As many people have commented poorly about this resort and others, you need to remember you are not at home, most of the people who live in these countries do not have large homes with 2 cars, a pool etc.
2646	0		We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it.
836	0		so I can't blame the hotel for that.
3363	0		We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found.
7055	0		There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where theyre trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police dont care that tourists are being preyed upon.
682	0		I had a nasty fall when the shower suddenly became very hot.
6126	0		They have a great happy hour with half price appetizers from 4-6 and again from 9-11.
6791	0		We recently stayed at the Luna Simone while traveling to London.
3995	0		And it is far, very far, from being even one of the top 5-6 resorts in the area.
1009	0		We went to visit the hotel to find that it was a converted apartment block in a rather seedy part of a very busy road.
112	0		and I enjoyed the location (near Brandenburg, Museum Island, etc), but I wasn't blown away.
5042	0		I cant imagine a more beautiful resort or more helpful staff.
6196	0		Havent been to NY in 25 years and I forgot how amazing this city is.
1638	0		Nothing spectacular.
1147	0		Well I don't agree with that
5297	0		It was in walking distance to all the major stores and resturant.
2855	0		and refurbishment is finished but not before then.
6390	0		An Excellent Return Stay
4923	0		We especially liked the tortilla.
1313	0		and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations.
3333	1		We will definately be returning, and recommending it to anyone we know is intending to visit Venice.
6375	0		The room was 4-star, but the lack of services ,e.g. pool, gift shop, make the entire property a 3.5 star.
4757	0		Just got back from our vacation in Italy in which we stayed three nights at this hotel.
5579	0		You have been warned, and we, I think, are nice people, who are often too timid to complain in any situation.
1587	0		(Eating cakes using a plastic credit card is quite ingenious I think!!) I was plagued by mosquitoes and have ended up with 6 nasty,
141	0		and they had a bunch of baby supplies for us that were helpful.
5158	0		It is wonderful.
1398	0		and when we asked the next day to be moved to a room with either twins or a decent-sized bed,
294	0		The sheets were not changed for three days
6324	0		I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
3896	0		Its not a huge room, but we werent in our room very often anyways.
2114	0		Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks.
1920	0		and we had a nice Space Needle view.
1639	0		I'd give it a better rating if there wasn't so many errors with the bill and checkin, but they seem to be trying
1151	0		and of course the bed was incredibly uncomfortable (same old mattress).
2527	0		and it was our third time being disappointed.
5362	0		We stayed at The Benjamin from Feb 18-24.
2643	0		Our pillowcases were stained,
3442	0		breakfast fantastic, as everyone has said before, and ate drank around the pool most days - certainly no complaints, and given the decent GBP/USD rate no complaints re prices.
4944	0		The room was small ,which I expected,, but nicely appointed and very clean.
1830	0		Overall, its a dark, dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff.
2937	0		and the Westin was booked out where i had been staying for 5 nights.
6973	0		We have stayed in several all-inclusive resorts that do deserve the rating.
7395	0		Restaurants are buffet style and a la carte.
660	0		The location of the hotel is right on Kurf��__rstendamm and very close to the Zoo and Ged�__nknich kirsche.
1847	1		Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.
1296	0		When I returned my main course in the restaurant because it was unacceptable (lobster the size of a prawn), they still expected me to pay for it.
4387	0		It has all the facilities of a 4 star hotel including a business centre, but beware they charge $17 for 30 minutes internet usage.
7500	0		There is an 8 pm light show at the harbor every night.
2597	0		Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all.
4198	0		We loved the beach Bar and julio mayo and Noe.
4588	0		Cons: free internet only in the business center which has only 2 computers with a sign ,15 minutes per guest only,.
4295	0		Buffet breakfast is very extensive.
2381	0		I will definitely be back.
7456	0		they put us in a room for 2 and got two other beds from some other room.
3534	1		The driver can take you from place to place, for a reasonable price.
4521	0		You almost never see anyone else ,apart from your butler who constantly comes to your door - even entering once without knocking,,
1614	0		Tips for Berlin: Public transport is brilliant.
6608	0		I had no complications at all with check-in or check-out, and I could see the beach from my room.
576	0		Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.
4770	0		The hotel was build in the Eastern Germany Days, but its renovated in most parts.
6915	0		A fun time though and the opportunity to see and get a feel for the local people.
4340	0		Just Right This hotel is in the perfect location, especially for the touristy traveler.
4381	1		So dont trust the staff, and be prepared for them to try it on and cause problems.
4514	0		I think that is not their business to judge
4460	0		They charge $30 an hour and it is worth it.
2596	0		My family and I stayed here during what will be remembered as one of the worst winters Seattle has seen in recent memory.
3048	0		I am very particular
1221	0		I use TripAdvisor.com regularly so when I saw that the Radisson SAS Berlin had been rated the number one hotel in the city I was confident I would be in for something special.
3971	0		Brilliant Berlin base
6477	0		Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly.
4709	0		Now my favorite part of course is the food.
5332	0		Im only 54 and my feet hung over the edge of the bed.
5567	0		Again, my husband walked, glasses in hand, and poured orange juice several times..
742	0		The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door.
6518	0		,In fact, upon my return home I started to redecorate my house because I enjoyed the minimalist aspect of the decor at BP.,
6264	0		I try to get the best value for my stay and will always be willing to pay a bit more if I think its worth it.
3800	0		THATS NOT A SUITE....THATS A LOAD OF CRAP.
5688	0		The entire suite was impeccably clean.
6012	0		Secure parking was a nice plus.
3455	0		Staying at the Chelsea Lodge makes u feel as if you are living there and not just a visitor to a typical sterile hotel room.
815	0		it was really tiny and did not have a bathtub like I requested.
6540	0		Bon Voyage
1214	0		I then walked over to the front desk, and requested that some bottled water be brought up to my room from room service.
1794	0		and just like the pool it was filthy.
1454	0		The actual hotel is very nice and has a quite expensive feel about it
6768	0		The bathroom was a nice size and had great amenities.
7158	0		Granted, its on the pricey end if youre a budget traveler, but I think you get your moneys worth if accommodations and service are important to you.
131	0		but still stumped at exactly what was so heavenly about the bed.
4046	0		They used Lavazza coffee cooker to provide the hot water, which is very dangerous.
4721	1		If you dont want anything just say no and they leave you alone.
7015	0		Beautiful grounds.
325	0		and it had a very strong, musty odour (mould perhaps?) At the front desk we were told that because they were fully booked, they could only offer us another room in the same grade, or a "renovated" room for an extra 30 Euros per night.
1129	0		Taking his advice was a big mistake - there are no trains to Schoenefeld via Bundes Platz on a Sunday.
2414	0		However, for reference, I stayed at the Seattle Grand Hyatt in January 2005 - that was a fantastic hotel - but costs a lot more too.
5610	0		If I had one complaint, it was the quality of the fruit served for breakfast.
132	0		It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable.
3250	0		Hotel is good for a home base, but not real big ,no business center, etc,.
1908	0		We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view.
1825	0		The hotel is located centrally
673	0		The pool area is fantastic
2321	0		The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle.
4285	1		The rooftop terrace offers a nice view of the city at sunset while enjoying a few evening drinks even in february I would definitely recommend this hotel and will have no hesitation in staying here again
7099	0		We were getting married in San Francisco and had heard great things about the PA.
937	0		The furniture is dark brown and very old and battered
6221	0		Pike Place is less than a 10 minute walk from the Westin and is definitely a must see.
3188	0		Room service was fantastic (gourmet larger than life BLT sandwiches and delicious kebabs  dips).
5755	0		Upon arrival to our room we found a beautiful arrangement of towel figures upon our bed along with Good night spelled out in flowers.
3306	0		The only other detractor was the bar - off to one side of reception and seemed like a last minute thought - slick service and a list of over 200 martini - we were sorry we didnt stay long enough to try them all.
5235	0		And most important of all, the service people - front desk, bellmen, restaurant staff, housekeeping - were beyond helpful, cooperative, cheerful and friendly.
7016	0		Clean everywhere - even the beach/pool bathrooms.
3073	0		The front desk staff was also very nice.
2116	0		I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room,
6876	0		You are treated as though you woke up that morning as Queen Elizabeth.
5475	0		We left our luggages at the front desk since the room reserved for us was still occupied.
6143	0		Yes, the room is small.
6205	0		I was in town on business and stayed at the Westin for just one night.
2060	1		Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.
4316	0		The rooms were average European size and the bathroom was very modern with plenty of hot water.
209	0		Renovated?
6232	0		We had a 2-room suite in the south point, very close to their awesome water park River Ranch.
4224	0		Other than that, our room was very clean and quiet.
544	0		It was not too heavy in my room since I aksed for non-smoking one.
3788	1		You can find specials and packages on their website..
6078	0		We waited thirty and it still had not arrived, so after two calls down ,and snotty clerks, we just left.
3550	0		There is a shortage of good local bars however but dont worry.
5679	0		I had to give her the url and number of the place to call.
5399	0		But as soon as you entered you could see the renovations
4321	0		All things considered, the Luna Simone is a great hotel and we would stay there again.
4719	1		If you do want to do any shopping like I said before to the left of the resort there is about 10 little shops.
3476	0		During our stay, we were able to obtain reservations for only two dinners.
5727	0		I hope that this is usefull to everybody.
4575	1		The room itself was small, but no smaller than other large city hotels- if you want room to walk, Id suggest taking the F down to Ferry Plaza.
5703	1		The shuttle isnt regular enough, and the town of Ubud is fantastic - loads of lovely restaurants, and quiet away from the main streets - I would really recommend staying in the town.
3813	0		The NewPort Beachside Resort had put a charge hold on my debit card.
914	0		Nice breakfast, although the breakfast room is quite crowded.
3606	0		On the other hand the staff was very friendly and honest.
256	0		but my points are valuable
15	0		Directly across the street from an informal bus terminus the hotel is also very convenient for the U-Bahn into town and some points in the East on foot, but quite a walk away from the heart of things.
2451	0		This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind,
5645	1		Perhaps the secret is to book the executive rooms because they certainly are spacious ,you can upgrade on check in,.
451	0		All in all, we had a great time.
2837	0		Still the service sucked!
3746	0		Overall, the room was worth the price.
200	0		and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay.
1312	0		All in all this hotel should be classified three star
5270	1		Dont expect ANYTHING to be included.

7364	0		It is also located in the Reforma district and in front of the Turibus stop where you can hop on and take a 4 hour tour of the city for nearly 100 pesos per day or 150 pesos for a 2 day weekend pass, which is well worth it.

1034	0		Room smelt of smoke when 'no smoking' requested.
4895	0		The others were nice and clean... especially liked the one with the pool bar

5026	0		Perhaps our table was a bit on the boring side, but the cook didnt even ineract with us.
2913	0		Valet parking was $35
2406	0		The cost of valet service wasn't really a problem here, but considering the size of the hotel, and the number of guests coming and leaving, there is a lot of congestion in the front and a considerable wait time.

1766	0		We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and the morning free coffee in the lobby.
5260	0		Taking the funicular down to the marina was a bit of a project.
717	0		Only when we called the front desk in the morning did they instruct us to remove the wood paneling below the sink in the bathroom (which revealed all of the pipes, etc.) and manually turn down the radiator (which was on 5 - the highest level!).
163	1		Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site.

4560	0		Head waiters from the restaurants to take the order mostly unfriendly - no smile.

4592	0		Used to stay at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers but when the rates when up found the Radisson online and it is right around the corner from the Boston Park Plaza.
2294	0		It was an adventure cycling from the airport to downtown- midday is the ony time to attemtp this.
762	0		and they let me print it for free in their business center.
839	0		but it was fairly modern,
2721	0		To be fair, Seattle parking in general is way overpriced -- comparable to NYC (where at least it seems merited).

4229	0		Walking the Freedom Trail also helped.
551	0		and my room smelled of smoke.

4102	0		To sum up, the holiday from beginning to end was perfect.
4268	0		So the hard work, quality food, and other amenities they are providing are 10X higher than what they are used to receiving in their day to day lives.
675	0		You have to pay to use the sauna area.
37	0		Overall, the stay at Berlin Mitte was not what I expected from a hotel chain which calls its most basic room 'Superior'.

4394	0		Quite easy not to talk to a soul here.
4161	0		We spent New Years Eve in this wonderful Hotel.
6243	0		Sometimes in Manhattan the hotels lean to business class or carry the attitude that theres more where you came from, consequently you dont get that personal service.

2767	0		and I would consider this hotel over the Westin aand W Seattle next time we are in town.
6387	0		Spent 3 nights at St Marie in Dec 2003.
3412	1		Top tip for frequent visitors is the Okura Club International which you can join for nothing and entitles bearers to free usage of the pool, showers and o-furo ,bath, which you would normally have to pay for.

5450	0		Its  a 5 minute walk or you can take a tram.
2468	0		It was expensive (parking is $35/night)
6493	0		Evidently they recently renovated and were unaware that in terms of noise, it was like sharing a room with your flooormate.
48	0		Close to museum island and U-ban just outside hotel.
595	0		If you're lucky you might just come across a great beer garden near the spanish?
3827	0		I really could not fault this hotel - the lobby and bar area is spacious and the breakfast had a wide range to suit all tastes.

5955	0		When I arrive the valet man start yelling at us.
4176	0		Many of the buildings in the French Quarter are very run down do to their age.
97	0		With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins.
6713	0		The service is top rate.
4938	0		Not only will you hear every flush your neighbor makes but also a tremendous amount of street noise.I have no idea how this hotel secured a 4-star rating.
224	0		The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor.
5024	0		For dinner we tried the Japaneese, Le Gourmet, Rodeo Steakhouse and main buffet.
3665	0		The service was second to none.....if you cant be pleased here than you cant be pleased anywhere.
6479	0		I would have rated it higher and Im very picky about hotel accomodations.
4040	0		However, what makes me angry is that when I try to contact the manager, Joanna Turmo, she will not take my calls, or return my calls.
4117	0		There is alway a breeze from the ocean, so it never feels too hot.
6010	0		In my opinion it was a great deal.
688	0		Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.
1840	0		The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor,
344	0		The Trader Vic's puts our Trader Vic's here in Emeryville to shame, both with respect to decor and food quality.
1994	0		It's an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions (five blocks from the waterfront) and there is a free bus in Seattle
2814	0		This Sheraton is definitely not a 4-star hotel
5851	0		Truly worth staying at this hotel.
1719	0		and the furniture is really old and mismatched.
7515	0		Free parking, which is a huge plus in Amsterdam.
4856	0		Once we got our keys, we headed off to our section.
3681	0		We would definetely stay at this hotel again.
5701	0		The setting and pool are gorgous, but as others have said there are nowhere near enough loungers, so people were lying on the floor - not what you expect from a 5 star hotel.
1043	0		all the doors are warped
5232	0		The obviously new beds and bedding were super-luxurious.
4576	0		If I was expecting the Hyatt, Id have been disappointed, but, for someone who travels extensively for work, this beats many chains hands-down
4667	0		Her response was, oh Ill take care of it.
7083	0		The Benihana type restaurant was just a show with everything dumped onto a plate.
1938	0		cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing.
2500	0		and all of the pipes were messed up.
4661	0		Problem is, the fishy smell overpowered the lounge, and the elevator landing outside.
5135	0		The waiter brought eggs and bacon instead.
3872	0		We had a view of Mt. Rainier the first leg, lower down the second.
3739	0		The staff were very very helpful, the rooms were wonderful Will we return??
2118	0		Very, very dissapointed.
2034	0		Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either Off or Automatic so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise.
5154	0		We arrived at noon and were in our room at 1.
5395	0		The better hotels should take notice Mosser, Great job
6700	0		Simply - THE BEST

3787	0		I really liked this place and will go back.
6319	0		Oh yeah, the casino is very nice, and drinks thre are always free ,Holdem tournament every Saturday Night,
469	0		The swimming pool and gym were both excellent,
1028	0		The shower in the bathroom simply sprayed water everywhere in the APART HOTEL (read falling APART Hotel) causing the bathroom floor to flood and cause a very dangerous health  safety hazardBreakfast in the Mark Hotel in Meineke Strasse was absolutely chaotic with surly, rude staff who snapped at you if you asked them to bring tea or coffee pots or more orange juice or bread fort oast.
2226	0		No A.C.!
661	0		We stayed in one of the renovated rooms after recommendation from Tripadvisor.
355	0		so were upgraded to executive room on the executive floor.
1470	0		I have no real complaints except that the inroom safe had to be paid for on a daily basis which was a little odd (maybe its a German hotel thing)I got a great winter deal on the room but be aware the buffet breakfast (which is very good) is not included in the price and is Very expensive (16 Euros p/p).
1876	0		and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time.
3865	0		great experience except... ...for the concierge problem.
1898	0		but there were a few problems worth mentioning.
149	0		Although I would think they could stop it a little earlier in the evening.
5514	0		I decided it offered the best value for money for what I was after and I wasnt to be disappointed.
1133	0		Check in was quick and effortless
6922	0		From the chromed elevator to the mysterious Murphy bed, the tear drop trash cans and the dimmable light tower, she was intrigued.
1681	0		and well kept with a mini fridge in the room that I really like, but sadly no coffee maker.
1098	0		Last two days in Germany so decided to push the boat out and book the *****, got a good price and most importantly the promise of a kingsize bed.
2380	0		and the location could not be better.
2279	0		It's a quick walk to the Public Market, downtown or the Seattle Art Museum.
5136	0		When I pointed out the mistake, he returned with sausage, then disappeared.
7497	1		Tips: When you take the tram going back to the hotel, make sure it does NOT say Happy Valley or Causeway Bay.

1095	0		I agree with another reviewer, that they have rooms for those that book a cheap rate
5275	0		We were very pleased with the Hotel Andra, which is downtown in the Belltown area.
2366	0		and there were no bath matts.
601	0		and I have to report that we were very satisfied with the Palace.

901	0		Tables were hardly ever cleared from the previous people
6824	0		We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.
5213	1		Ask for room with an odd number thats starts over 13.
4975	0		With this in mind, it may sway us from visiting this property again, which is a great shame as otherwise our experience was faultless.
4660	0		There were mini crab cakes, shrimp and a big pot of gumbo.
2371	0		This was actually not too big of a deal.

4079	0		We were told to make the reservation at the Customer Relations desk.
5358	0		Location is excellent.
3316	0		The double glazing kept out all noise, and the shutters were excellent too.

7024	0		Cocktail, maybe some fruit or the best guacamole you ever had.
3633	0		Inconvenient to everything.
4100	0		What an AMAZING resort
2260	0		After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!!

5989	0		Great location, views
3126	0		Otherwise: nice size rooms, good security, friendly staff, clean, and the employees were professional and friendly.
6697	0		Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia.
3181	1		One thing: definitely try to get a high floored room away from the building works for the new skyscraper next floor.
5522	0		During our time in the States we had stayed at other more basic hotels which offered free wifi in rooms.
6351	0		This hotel was conveniently located, though not on the beach.
4625	0		Let me explain.

6352	0		However..it was in need of some updates and doesnt have a very welcoming atmosphere.
4486	0		The room was more than adequate for our needs.

6169	0		However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use.
1308	0		and we had to traipse all the way back to reception to be told that our three day booking had mistakenly been entered as two days - for this they did not apologise -

6674	0		It is very romantic, and the service is just outstanding

6361	0		But the location was just unacceptable for a pleasure trip.

2141	1		there are two lots on either side of the hotel or try the Bon/Macy's parking lot for something a bit cheaper.

21	0		This hotel is located in a very quiet district - barely a passing car on a weekday, completely dead at the weekendand with no local facilities.
6076	0		Considering I had just arrived ,with my three kids, it wasnt likely I was buying drinks for some stanger in a bar.
5124	0		Because I am an inTouch member, a gift of a bottle of water and a bar of chocolate were waiting for me on the nightstand.

496	0		and the location was perfect.
159	0		When we were shown to our room we were given a twin bedded room in the old part of the hotel.
1605	1		and in my oppinion a hostel would be better than wasting your money on a somewhat dodgy three stars.
5476	0		When we came back in the afternoon, our luggages had been brought in the room at 2nd floor.
4313	0		Nice hotel, great location The Luna
6190	0		Only one thing the shower doesnt have a lot of hot water - the water was just warm enough to have a shower but not comfortably warm.

2733	0		Everyone has their hand out (not unusual at a hotel like this, but even more blatant here -- and without much of a smile or effort) When I have to open my trunk and pack my bags in the car, it seems impertinent to be expecting a tip just for bringing the car up.

2415	0		My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle a few weeks ago.
6864	0		I wouldnt come back here if I measured this trip solely based on food but check the other reviews for comments on the two reservation only restaurants ,Le Gourmet and Matsuri, because the food their might be really good.

6142	0		Small, but sexy room
6972	0		We just think that the hotel does not deserve five stars.
1104	0		and there was a gap between the bedside table and the mattress!!
5769	0		I call the desk again and voice my displeasure and request a new room, which they take care of in about 30 minutes.
7509	0		This is an up-scale, luxury property and not where college frats would stay and have wild parties, but thats how the fellow union member was treated.

4444	0		Most of the items were deep fried.
2774	0		and they took my name.

2169	0		and her friends could see a concert there.
3155	0		I did find the hotel to be a bit over priced for what we got.
5795	0		Approx 8/10mins cab ride to the Bogatell beach , this was roughly 9-10euros, worth it as we tried the metro that was a nightmare experience because of the heat.
1089	0		and a bit disgusted.
1453	0		It wasn't all bad though.
5981	0		Anyone running a bath/shower or using a hair dryer could be doing so in your own room.
7049	0		The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you dont bring your laptop, using the hotels computers costs 6 euros an hour.
3504	0		Loved it all
5009	0		But building #2 is so much closer to the pool they eventually switched us.
3602	0		Not that big of a deal but maybe spend the $$ fixing these instead of a celing mounted radio that is useless
3569	1		So, be sure to tell them in advance if noise bothers you.
3928	0		Desk staff was friendly and very helpful at booking tours and providing directions.
1762	0		Didn't get it...
1800	0		although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.

3698	0		My view ,20th floor, looked west to north and was pretty nice.
5967	0		Then on checkout, there was yet another mess.
1712	0		just extra unneccessary hassle.
2942	0		and although I didn't get time to drink there - the lobby bar looked really inviting.
684	0		One of the reasons why there appears to be a difference of opinion regarding the star rating for this hotel is possibly because the hotel is made up of two distinct blocks.
6084	0		However, I was told that many of the hotel rooms are very small, I dont know if this is true.
5626	0		I felt right at home in the neighborhood of the Monarch, then again I live right outside of Newark NJ, which explains why our car was keyed and our mirror was ripped off.
2622	0		Nize size rooms with adequate bath.
2727	0		but they could not locate.

6663	0		Terrific Boutique Hotel
4199	0		At night there is not much Adult entertainment.
5638	0		We stayed in the front and the traffic and other street noise was very loud.
6309	0		To get from the resort to the airport was about 30 miles and cost $80 dollars each way, but remember, youre still basically in the United States.
5757	0		I called the bellman back along with the representative that checked us in and was assured it would be taken care of while we went to get something to eat.
4782	0		And the rooms must be well insulated, because I did not ever notice any jet engine noise.
238	1		If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.
1683	0		Having never been to Seattle, I am pleased with the Warwick and my stay there.
3728	0		This hotel is on the other side of the Piazza from the bus stop ,caddy corner to the large statue at the archway of the Piazza,.
4165	0		There are some who seem to be just doing a job but this is compensated by the others who are the best.
3540	0		I did require a doctor whilst there as I had forgot to pack some cruical medication that was available on prescription only.
1280	0		I think this was because of the spree river
7193	0		We paid an extra $30 for an upgrade to an ocean view room and the view was fabulous
5245	0		It had a marble countertop, two cushioned bar stools w/ backs, two refrigerators under the sink/countertop.

2920	0		Put the AC on high, but the room still felt like a sauna.
5498	0		Not many places to eat, but there is a great market a block away.
5237	0		We will definitely return.

1968	0		My husband and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights this summer.
5826	0		I must say it was great

4587	0		Pros: location, clean large room.
2812	0		and timeliness of service was an issue as well.
6332	0		The hotel is small and so are the rooms, but everything is comfortable.
4821	1		If you are a drinker you will feel like you died and went to heaven; one can drink the day away with many choices and the $76.00 will feel like a bargain.
1510	0		It wasn't true but it was quite embarrassing
1094	0		Here there were individual amenities, albeit cheap ones -- not luxurious by any means, robes, and the room just seemed genenally cleaner and brighter.
6975	0		Im an HHonors member so stay in Hiltons all over, but this is my favorite.
3724	0		Two welcome drinks at their bar.
4028	0		On Wednesday night, they serve lobster at the buffet.

7278	0		The lobby is very nice and modern looking with white and grey marble.
3431	0		Next time we are in San Fran we will likely stay at the Westin, but as a more economical alternative only 2 blocks down, this place is great

7174	0		The bedding is old, and pillows lumpy.
6963	0		We had to air out our suitcases.
1396	1		Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).
6222	0		Try to get there early though, because this is tourist central and it really got crowded later in the day.
2758	0		For $200 I would like a turn down and chocolate, decent room service and not have to spend a fortune on the phone or internet acess.
5889	0		Secure safe in the room for your valuables.

4014	0		You could be in the sun or in the shade.
536	0		Breakfast is great.
3355	0		Its an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions ,five blocks from the waterfront, and there is a free bus in Seattle but we could never figure out how that worked ,do some research before you go,.
7114	0		The best room we have ever had.

253	0		I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable.
7357	0		There are three computers near check-in desk that are available to guests 24/7, that was very much appreciated.
5128	0		The bed was extremely comfortable.
3427	0		Several times they assisted us with public transportation schedules and attraction information.
5157	1		So bottom line is if you are an average american like me go to this resort.
2302	0		Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite.
3738	1		I would recommend the place to anyone on a budget as you get a clean room for the money but I dont think Id stay here again.
4128	0		The sparkling wine is really good and can become addictive.
1451	0		It had all the usual, egg, bacon, cheeses etc but no smoked salmon and was not great for a 4 star hotel.
6600	0		Overall we think you get great value for money.
6468	0		The difference is with the hotel, you have in/out privileges and its the same price, whereas, if you park you car at one of the lots, once you leave, you have to pay again to re-enter
2983	0		Great hotel Lobby and pretty big hotel with numerous elevators, so you dont have to wait much.
7221	0		Add me to the list of those who love this hotel

3273	0		Have recently returned from a four night stay in the lenox a great experience.
1029	0		A member of our group was sent by reception to two local dry cleaners shops to get an outfit for that evening ironed before sending her to their hotel accross the street where they had a laundry facility all the time thus wasting an hour and making her late for her evening function.
6487	0		Great sound system for docking ipod.

6455	0		The hotel is clean, the rooms were comfortable.
4494	0		This is the second time that we are staying at Lanson Place, Hong Kong.

5547	0		We ordered pizza one night, and it never came, nor did we see our waiter after ordering d the situation.
3979	0		Very nice hotel, but rooms are small and area is newer live/work type.

6102	0		The staff were very helpful and always polite.
7460	0		breakfast consisted of bread, 3 different cold cuts and juices so you better be early at the breakfast table otherwise they do not re-stock.

606	0		Staff are very helpful, attentive, smiling and say hello to you in the morning.
556	0		One evening I returned to my room to find both windows open.
3631	0		Situated in a section of Madrid east of the Retiro park, you could be anywhere where high rise buildings predominate.
6847	0		A Beautiful Deal
6318	0		A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all.
6226	0		Check out time is noon, and since my flight was not until 10 p.m. that night, they let me store my suitcase in their luggage storage room.
3548	0		In restaurant the food quality is good.
6779	0		Personally, I feel the best service the hotel provides is its complimentary meal and snack service throughout the day.
2296	0		Paul
6330	0		Nor is the hotel filthy or a wreck as some of the reviewers have stated.
2998	0		The Market and Mall are all in walking distance

6211	0		After I checked in, I went down to the fitness room for a quick workout and found it to be really nicely equipped.
1951	0		we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will be fixed immediately--I promise.
5905	0		It was a perfect location, allowing us to get out quickly to see the sights, and make easy visits back for a rest or to freshen up.
2177	0		and one that had not been renovated.
5131	0		The bathroom amenities were LOccitane.
3396	0		Now, the only negative about this room...the shower.
1081	0		I do usually stay in 4 star hotel and have stayed in better 4 stars than the  5 star Steigenberger Berlin.
4720	0		They try there best to sell you anything.
568	0		We also found the location to be very good for sightseeing, shopping, etc as well.
2007	0		and only then did they find the reservation.
259	0		that same awful smell would drift by.
5162	0		LOVED the Hotel Lungarno
4640	0		The room was small with no view.
2438	0		Its location made up for its weaknesses,
6994	0		Free breakfast was good and the valet guys were good.
4627	0		BUT, this hotel made NO mention of any renovations on their website.
4269	0		Just thought I should mention this as I have stayed at 3 star, 4 star and 5 star hotels in the Dominican and the difference between them is minimal as far as the quality of food.
3545	0		The room, all mod cons, plasma, dvd, stereo, wireless keyboard for the internet ,chargeable,, quiet and reliable air con, nice window seat built into the ledge, reasonable min bar prices, pillow menu, slippers, gown etc.
6850	0		We still cant believe we stayed at such a beautiful place with such great service for the amount of money we paid.
533	0		There is no non-smoking section in the bar and quite frankly, if you are not a smoker yourself,
3255	0		Good price ,$200, for a clean, safe, mid-town room ,2 double beds, that includes breakfast.
739	0		The bathroom door has a hole for a handle,
7185	0		The atmosphere in the room got hot, damp and unpleasant and having to get someone to open en close your window for you is every time you want to do something about it is irritating.
7010	0		There were plenty of chairs near the pool and we all won at the casino.
4024	0		Every night the kids were involved in putting on little shows.
6257	0		The room and bathroom were big - for Europe.
5689	0		I have travelled many, many times and this by far was the nicest budget-minded hotel I have ever stayed in.
1503	0		The other thing is that the inroom wifi is outrageously priced at EUR9 for 2 hours.
5470	0		To us the hotel is most likely a 2 stars with a 4 stars bathroom facility.
2827	0		I ended up calling and talking to the manager about the reservations department.
5469	0		We stayed there for 3 nights late December 2003.
1716	0		(It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk).
5333	0		Also you could feel the springs digging into your back all night long.
157	0		and the old is 2 star.
4774	0		I stayed here regularly for work for about 2 months this year.
5824	0		Breakfast was great and catered for all the health freaks to full on english breakfast and cakes.
6401	0		First thing we noticed were the meticulously landscaped lawns and gardens.
4192	0		Hector at the front desk was great.
3323	0		Entertainment was provided by the Gondoliers based at the Gondola station right outside the notel, their banter is wonderful to watch.
3294	0		but it has a very nice location.
158	0		When we arrived we were impressed by the lobby and the friendly staff.
2361	0		We saved money staying in one of their shared bath suites.
5996	0		I wish I had read reviews on this site prior to booking.
468	0		The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate!
5784	0		False advertising aside, I feel as if I didnt get the exclusive all inclusive treatment that they advertise and that I paid for.
963	0		The main reception area and corridors stink of cigarette smoke as there is a table and chairs positioned along the corridor for smokers.
1806	0		and boy were we disappointed!
2239	0		We have never been disappointed.
1699	1		I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.
710	0		The rooms are very TIRED.
4529	0		Moderate pricing and quiet location with parking, ,Fee $9 to $12,, yet still close to the Waikiki scene made it a good choice for us.

6735	0		Lovely staff, great for business
7128	0		I do not know about the location and it did not really matter because taxis are readily available and very inexpensive.
1663	0		It was ridiculous.
5911	0		Our room was towards the back of the hotel, and the smell became evident the further back you walked.
1670	1		My recommendation: Save your money!
2341	0		Couples may feel more comfortable
3552	0		Again same price to the Mall at Harbour city which is a good one in my opinion.
996	0		Brekfast is plentiful but very basic.

4723	0		At the resort there is photo studio.
5491	0		Great price too
5208	1		Tip-join their members club ,free, via their website before you book, and then you truly get treated royally .i.e upgrade to suites, free calls, free welcome snacks, daily papers etc.
6285	0		Best of all - all the staff are so friendly, informative and helpful.

4070	0		Hotel extremely clean and everything extremely well manicured.
5049	0		I liked the hotel as it was close to all that I wanted to see and do.
754	0		Alltogether I enjoyed my stay and would book again at anything below $120 a night.
7175	0		The promised cookies and milk in the evenings did not come as scheduled and the breakfast items were slim.
3056	0		We walked all over town from here.
4753	0		The dead mouse outside the front door didnt help- nor did the refuse container outside the front door ,it was not emptied the entire time we were there-overfull with food, butts, styrofoam cups, etc and smelled horrible,.
5885	0		Loved it An absolute gem of a hotel
6355	0		OK the value is good and the hotel is reasonably priced, but the service is terrible.
6516	0		I like to come and go unnoticed as though I were walking into the front door of my own home.
3391	0		The computer guides you through the system; however, two guest service personnel stand by for your convenience.
1953	0		the food was fantastic,the staff very helpful only complaint I asqued for two beds and got one
7213	0		We had travelled from fiji to Auckland, sat in Auckland airport all day then had a 12 hour flight to San Francisco.
6840	0		We were finally given an alternate room, which did not have as good a view as originally ordered, but was OK.
2888	0		Anything you could think of that's located off of I-5's "Downtown Exits" is a few blocks away, even Pike Place Market, great restaurants, music venues, shopping (including Nordstrom's flagship store)...ok, so why did I rate the hotel "Okay, but some problems"?
6323	0		The rooms were clean and the bathroom was completely up to date.
2413	0		So overall, no complaints, it is a very good hotel.
980	0		I have just returned from a weekend in Berlin, where I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel.
4523	0		The hotel is a few blocks removed from the noise and activity of Waikiki, so things are a little quieter.
5005	0		The regular junior suites are amazing.
1696	0		And best of all, I booked this room on Expedia for a mere $105/night.
322	0		you have been given a discount special!
1724	0		Everything else was a crap shoot.
6383	0		The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.

3161	0		I'm still raving about them.
5388	0		Bus to the ballpark is right in front.
5740	0		The staff were welcoming and helpful with suggestions of where to eat and what to do.

6981	0		The Hilton accepted this without any drama; one staff in the exec lounge was at first unaware of the hotel policy on assistance dogs; one cleaning woman seemed to be terrified of the dog, otherwise Pema quickly become a favorite with the other hotel guests.
2436	0		Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel.
477	0		we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.

527	0		Rooms are very spacious
3475	0		There was so much demand that all spots available were filled before 9:00am.
783	0		Staff was not especially friendly,
1760	0		Instead of duvet there a blanket placed between two sheets, swimming pool is very very small but also very very dirty,
7283	0		The bed itself was very comfortable and the linens and comforter were impressive.
2655	0		and that some fees usually apply,
6436	0		Many attractions are also accessible just by walking.
5748	0		Wonderful concierge who recommended restaurants as well as sent me to a bike shop where i could rent a bike to ride around frankfurt for the day.
7179	0		Nice, but not top quality
3416	0		Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohamas Chinatown - but it is very good if youre feeling lazy and cant be bothered to venture out of the hotel.
6648	1		La Luna could dampen this noise significantly if they were to seal the door so that it fits better in the door frame.
2608	0		Service was okay but not quite the same as a Grand Hyatt or similar.
3240	0		The continental breakfast on offer was ideal with bagels ,cereals ,tea coffee, fresh fruit.
5027	0		Le Gourmet was good.

4609	0		A few police/sheriffs officers were present, and very polite and helpful in providing taxi info.
465	0		Throughout the stay the hotel staff were all very helpful and polite, and of course all spoke excellent English - as usual compounding my misery at being uni-lingual!
6731	0		We got a special deal of 200 euros per night and this made the stay even better.
1211	0		and we will bring it to you.
5075	0		kind of set in a walled garden area.
4616	0		Cabs to the hotels are a flat $11.00 ,which includes a $1.00 fuel surcharge,.
4703	0		It had a 2 person jacuzzi.
7313	0		I will be telling all of my friends about the Gardens.
5946	0		I know that sounds crazy but even the mixer were a little odd.
1560	0		and in this case I would stay here again.
723	0		one would figure, they would give the room a very good cleaning the next day - well, that didn't happen.
2709	0		No one told us the gym was closed.
2838	0		Rude staff and to top it off you have to pay for the Wi Fi!!!
592	0		Both a great day out.
3529	0		Our room was small, but very clean and had a nice high ceiling and a safe.
2769	0		that's just how it is!
6581	0		Theres no scene at The Marseilles at night, but thats OK with so many other options all around.
39	0		For UK travellers, the room was the same size
809	0		But then it turns out that there where 2 rooms in my room.
2038	0		The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area.
270	0		I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.
500	0		Little gifts everyday of our stay made it easier to be away from home during the holiday.
5699	0		A couple who ordered food after us were given complimentary drinks because of the wait, but we werent.
4400	0		The hotel is very dated and in need of a LOT of work.
3566	1		It is in a great location for the Hollywood area, it is right next to a subway stop, but to get around in Los Angeles you will need a car.
3723	0		This hotel was very clean, large bathroom and the closet space was great too.
6670	0		From house-keeping to reception, they were extremely friendly, professional, and concerned for our well-being.
2822	0		That was it.
4790	0		I cant go into everything in detail, but EVERYTHING was great Want to go back ASAP
4903	0		The place has a lot of potential, so I think that once they actually start renovating the rooms it will be a great place.
540	0		The room decor was a classy, and yet cosy.
5542	0		One person would bring water, the other appetizers..
4208	1		Also bring comfy shoes, ALOT of walking, take advantage of the golf carts to bring you to the other hotels at night.
5236	1		I highly recommend this hotel for families and/or friends who want to hang out together instead of booking small separate rooms.
1866	0		So, we tried to avoid using it during the night in order to sleep and if possible only
2372	0		The staff was very nice and helpful.
4858	0		We were in Block 6 ,Elite Club section, and were treated to an oceanview room on the first floor.
6974	0		I stay here every business trip to Sydney
5412	0		It was also very nicely tucked on a side street so it was always very quiet.
4304	0		The rooms are small and there is no place to move but I guess it is ok for the price.
5066	0		Great location, cost effective
3859	0		Room service was quick and efficient.
3041	0		We had an appointment to which we were late,
3215	0		What a great example of classic service.
4378	0		Basically the hotel had delibearatley overbooked and told us barefaced lies to cover up, knowing there was nothing we could do about it.
2743	0		I had to have lights replaced and something else repaired.
6893	0		A movie at 8pm, a show ,usually a performance of some kind, at 10pm and an on the property disco/sportsbar after the performance.
2465	0		I know that leaving something behind is my mistake,
4840	0		The hotels there could have been anywhere in the world, only the fact that the word Bali appeared on signs gave you any hint as to where you were.
7106	0		Many, many thanks to all at the Petite Auberge .. especially, Anna, Mary, Tina, Andy, the day desk clerk whose name escapes me and manager Eric.
5837	0		i got engaged on the beach here and had the time of our lives.
6649	0		This is also a source of cold air.
1160	0		Berlin has an awful lot of construction going on so choose carefully.
1646	0		Translate it: Old and unrelenting.
532	0		Sometimes, the smoke is drifting through the lobby and makes the whole place very unpleasant.
5319	0		therefore pretty much ruining our vacation along with many other peoples.
6466	0		We were told that other hotels in the French Quarter charge roughly the same price.
1257	0		It was a huge struggle to get a nice room,
3568	0		We were placed next to the service elevator and the walls were on the thin side.
2895	0		Never heard any of the other occupants, great bathroom and toiletries, fantastic amenities for guests in the lobby (including a great coffee/breakfast-to-go/sandwich place with rockin' breakfast sandwiches at affordable prices) and lots of computers, lots of staff, great bellmen...... but at a normal price of about $350 per room a night, an extra $40 for parking doesn't leave you with a great taste in your mouth....
1984	0		One bellhop guy almost ran over some kids who were standing with their parents in the lobby waiting to check in,
3395	0		The TV and the room remote control is awesome.
2080	0		My husband and I stayed at The Moore for 3 nights/4 days beginning on September 15th.
5641	0		While the room was a bit small, the bathroom was quite large.
2472	0		We had a plasma in our king room
4863	0		It was extremely humid so I imagine its quite difficult for things to dry properly there... hence the mold.
2866	0		I only wanted oatmeal,
6025	0		We explained that they were our friends FROM SF there to show us around...only helping us carry our luggage.
52	0		The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.
4934	0		Hardly 4-star I stayed at this hotel while on a business trip.
2800	0		Would stay here again.
3992	0		My wife and I were given a view which overlooked a parking lot and other peoples balconies.
7374	0		I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room.
1159	0		but the location could be right oppposite a building site or miles from the nearest bars and restaurants, or just in the wrong part of town.
1338	0		several design solutions were just very awkward.
5403	0		Not much of a view as all the surrounding buildings are the same height.
811	0		Nothing.
3210	0		The beds were unreal.
3018	0		and I asked where the pool is located to be told the pool is closed for remodeling until September or October.
420	0		The room is avarage in size.
5099	0		Great hotel with great Staff
3612	0		However, just a couple of small things - one of our triple rooms was really small, only fit as a double and there was no mirror in the bedroom at all, just the bathroom mirror so it was a bit of hassle when 3 women were getting ready to go out.
503	0		The German staff was attentive to our requests without exception.
7137	0		It is family owned.
1885	0		and he sent me down the wrong street.
1265	0		All other major attraction is about 15mins away.
5205	0		I spent 11 nights in the Wyndham Boston, and found it to be an excellent hotel.
6124	0		The breakfast selection was terrific and of course the dinner was fabulous.
192	0		and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality.
7134	0		Great Location for the Price
6038	0		The hotel staff was very helpful and we felt very welcome at the hotel.
3750	0		The service was excellent and we found that the staff went out of their way to accomodate us ,make dinner reservations, give directions, taxi pick-ups, etc.,.
7261	0		The food was good for an all-inclusive.
2056	0		The hotel is well located within the downtown core
4668	0		Not Im sorry or some other words of concern, just Oh.
1065	0		1st impression were great of the hotel,
4694	0		Its a very quick ride.
2477	0		And the concierge was extremely helpful.
3095	0		The location was great--close to Pikes Market and great shopping.
5484	0		We will absolutely stay there again if we get back to Florence one day.
5206	0		Staff were top-notch, and quality of service second to nothing.
3644	0		We had a room with double and single bed and it was a reasonable size.
1981	0		We do not have kids of our own,
2845	0		Only after I made it to the lobby was I offered help with the luggage.

1494	0		I thought I should share my experiences with readers on this site.
2184	0		while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away.
143	0		The location is absolutely ideal for a tourist trip to Berlin.

160	0		We had booked a double bed.
1481	0		I have stayed 7 nights
6457	0		This hotel is in the French Quarter not far from Bourbon Str and you can definitely hear the music and noise.

4465	0		We did however get some anti-Malaria pills from our doctor as there have been some outbreaks in the Punta Cana area this year.
3235	0		The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and courteous.

2502	0		and the server showed up just as I was leaving to attend a meeting.
756	0		Like one of the other reviewers, I was also impressed that the room was ready when I arrived in the morning.
4780	0		The service is first class.
6597	0		Always ready to help or offer advice.

6378	0		We shopped at Macys and went to Walgreens for our snacks.
5263	0		The ferry ran every 1/2 hr and only took about 8 minutes to get there, but we just missed the ferry and had to sit and wait for the next one so from the time we left our room it was about 45 minutes until we got to the beach.
1912	0		The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era cans (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed.
6163	0		At first a little apprehensive - website looks great, but a little out of the way in Mongkok.
5322	0		Hi everyone by the adult pool
2446	0		The best thing about this hotel is its location.
7372	0		The outer rooms are exposed brick and apparently ours was allowing moisture into the room.
31	0		During my stay I needed to use the internet in order to check-in for our return flight.
705	0		The Reichstag Dome, TV Tower at Alexanderplatz, and Pergamon Museum are all worth a visit.
3952	0		At least there you can get good service and a more confortable experience.
842	0		but we found it to be very quiet actually.
3527	0		As late June is in the rainy season, the air was quite clean.
5462	0		The manager should have been promoted long ago,-I will never again meet such a Man who was so happy to help and rectify any problems- he was wonderful.
4277	0		At first the check in person at the convenience store would not give me another room stating that everything was taken until we realized that the toilet was leaking into the bedroom.
3650	0		I went with my 15 year old daughter and a friend of mine.
3164	0		Clearly a luxury hotel but surprisingly ordinary.

4791	1		Business oriented, and highly recommeded for that purpose
3508	0		Big enough and confortable for my husband, daughter and me.
5481	0		The location is best, near the train station ,5 minutes walk, and many budget eating houses nearby.
7159	0		Ill definitely be back.
4602	0		In the end, not even close to worth it.
6832	0		It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything.
6835	0		Caribe Hilton is one of the first Hiltons in the chain, built in 1947, and continually upgraded.
6897	0		The only area of major concern for us was that we overheard a guest being asked to sleep at a neighboring resort for one night because they did not have room for him.
5601	0		We were on the third floor looking over the roof - hardly any view of the ocean at all.
995	0		but I suppose that is just me.
3472	0		We had to eat at dirty tables, surrounded by dirty dishes to consume lukewarm or cold meals.
2742	0		The lobby and rooms were a little shabby.
2192	0		The second night I was pulling down the covers and crawling around on my pillow were 2 BED BUGS!

3669	0		Good hotel We booked our hotel and flight to
1865	0		The hotel personnel told that it is a standard noise for all rooms.
1514	0		the hotel is near Alexander Platz,
5571	0		Punta Cana was pretty, but no better thappreciate tourism.
4807	0		All in all if price is an issue stay here.
5868	0		I really do not understand all the negative comments.
4724	0		Its $8 per page, they take about 40 pictures and you pay for what you want.
4955	0		Fantastic, Fabulous, just perfect
3429	0		We love boutique hotels with eclectic features, so this was a good fit for us.
1346	0		This door wasn't even full-length, so it must be a real problem for American couples with their hang-ups about bodily sounds when on the toilet.
1808	0		so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home.
1586	0		my son asked very politely at the reception to borrow 2 forks, guess what...we weren't allowed!!
1240	0		As too are the room doors so you cannot hear any other guests or morning maid service in the hallways.
1864	0		In all 3 rooms, there was a loud sound coming from the air conditioner/ heating system which we found unbelievable for an hotel.
6151	0		I will certainly stay here again when I pass through.

6733	0		All in all and excellent place to stay and highly recommended.
3297	0		The hotel is lovely - all rooms have balconies and we chose the Executive Suite - lots of space and a lovely bathroom.
1521	0		and the decision was primarily based on cost and the reviews listed here.
3211	0		If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable.
6885	0		The great price you will get to stay at this resort should make tipping easier for all.

405	0		The room air conditioning had a hard time keeping up with the warm temperatures in Berlin.
3661	0		Very energetic and funny.

848	0		Fantastic Hotel.
44	0		Rooms nices, Staff helpful.
6260	0		Walls were a bit thin, but we didnt have any major issues.
990	0		Fair enough, but I think there is only one floor in the whole building (of 7 floors) that is non-smoking, so be aware of that when booking.
3717	0		The lobby was a little small and got crowded one monrning whena larger group of people arrived.
2227	0		Situation: 2 blocks from the market and 2 blocks to the downtown shops.
4308	0		We could not sit on our 25th floor balcony and enjoy the ocean views without the daytime sounds of ear-splitting, pile-driving machines and other construction equipment.
114	0		and the room itself was quite comfortable--but very small.
6910	0		We used Prieto, but found the Apple tours to be better organized.
1363	0		When I sat in the cocktail lounge for a drink, I had to wait for ages to be served (along with several other tables).
4644	0		Also, construction on the street starts at about 6:30 AM so forget about sleeping in.
1150	0		The new room (554) at least had a double bed (but alas still two tiny duvets)
6573	0		It seemed recently renovated with an updated decor.
3753	0		A few minor down sides were tin roof ,we had 3rd floor room and heavy rains were LOUD,, roosters making noise quite often ,yes, even in middle of night,, and rental charges for everything ,bikes, towels, chairs, etc.,
2871	0		and I would pick it up after dinner.
8	0		as are the rooms.
6687	1		If you are looking for a fancy, corporate Marriot or Sheraton, this is not the place for you.
4565	0		We were blinded with the wonderful brochure and the webside about this Hotel Paradisus.
1589	1		I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I liked.

4919	0		We found the hotel on Tripadvisor and advised our travel agent to book.
5145	0		I am from middle class america and I was very satisfied.

3680	0		We tried the bakery across the road, had cold pizza and cake, very nice.
6104	0		I think it was called Ginger.

4426	0		The food was mediocre and the selection is small ,compared to other resorts we have been to,.
3846	0		The shampoo felt like watered down laundry detergent.
2349	0		I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.
6282	0		We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building.
4726	1		If you have any questions just e-mail me: Jillanson@excite.com

4455	0		There was garbage ,straws, cigarette butts, cups, broken glass, all over the place.
4480	0		The restaurant attached to the hotel, however, is quite mediocre and very noisy, with unresponsive staff.
834	0		This was a big let dow for me,since I am used to having that,
5017	0		If you havent cruised before, then youd probably think the food was pretty good.
1323	0		The check-in man then rang the hotel's reservation office
6021	0		Unfortunately, we were not very pleased.
3373	0		It was easy to find, parking for free is a bonus and boy oh boy was Versa a wealth of information

5051	0		We stayed in room 408 and it was great.
2824	0		They just had this attitude that was not appreciated!
2715	0		I stayed at the Sheraton this time primarily due to an internet price offer and the 4 star rating of the hotel.

5822	0		It adds a cosy feel without losing the sleekness.
7059	0		Great place to vacation.
4763	0		The owners and receptionists spoke English and were very, very nice and accommodating - helped us with directions and book reservations at museums, etc.

5494	0		I thought the hotel would be packed, but there seemed to be plenty of romms available.
5936	0		A buck goes a very long way.

6751	0		I ordered room service one day ,$28, ouch,,
6643	0		Nice resort if you just like the ocean but definitely NOT A GOLF RESORT.
4878	0		You go to a mini buffet first for your side dishes and the servers bring you cuts of meat ,shish kabob style, directly to your table.
4513	0		They said I shouldnt have any problem with the distance since San Fran is a very small city, you can take the bus around.
3296	0		We chose the Mandarin Oriental as we felt to old for South Beach and we were glad we made the right choice.
6040	0		After reading all these good reviews I stayed in first class room ,nothing first class about it; small room, no amenities - shampoo etc available, and after the third night ,they had not changed the sheets, I found a little blood in the sheets.

524	0		Comfortable large and clean.
922	0		Pleasant stay just before christmas, hotel was quite packed.

4705	0		The pool is amazingly HUGE.
1991	1		It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.
1405	0		If I ever book the Alsterhof again, I'll be sure to ask for a decent bed!
3360	0		Our only complaints concerned the front desk.

6701	0		Boy, its going to be tough to write this review.
54	0		Walking time to many sights (Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmakt, Deutches Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Nikolaivertel etc. was less than 15 minutes - while virtually everything else was easily accessible by U-Bahn, starting almost next door.

147	0		The hotel is a great building.
4197	0		A few went on the ATVs and loved it, but a bit more dangerous.
2574	0		There was no concierge
6676	0		Super Clean
2891	0		and so we decided to splurge....what we DIDN'T know is that overnight parking in the Sheraton's garage is $40 per night.
6658	1		Recommend walking two blocks to Judys cafe on Chestnut St. for breakfast ,they only take cash, but good portions of good food,.
470	0		although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna...
26	0		though the bed was amply sized as in all German hotels.
4883	0		The main course was tasty, but I found the sushi wasnt extremely fresh.
2351	0		so we contacted the hotel after arriving in Seattle.
5644	0		Needless to say, because of previous comments, was a bit wary but how wrong could you be?
277	0		but a refurbishment programme is in progress (we had a note apologising for any noise heard though we did not hear any).
4887	0		Service..No complaints here.
1437	0		It is 20 minutes walk to the hotel from there or 5 minutes by cab.
5013	0		There is absolutely no information in your room about anything to do with the resort.
1496	0		On both counts the Alsterhof let me down.
4276	0		I was first given room #1, very dark and damp, had a basement feel since it was on the ground floor half buried in dirt.
3016	0		Lovely room.
619	0		Which for this hotel was very good value.
7343	0		The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.
4574	0		We were on 8th floor, so very little street noise- asked to be away from kids
4488	0		We were on the 7th floor so noise was not a problem.

2962	0		They had one computer located at the check-in desk

3067	0		it was very drab.
2755	0		The pool is indoors upstairs and has a strong chlorine smell that wafts to the fancy ballroom.
416	0		It is in a very good location - tube stop right outside or walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie.
3414	0		I really cant imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope its true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite.
4833	0		All it was promised to be, rooms were spacious, beds were great.
4579	0		The location in a quiet residential neighborhood was great for us, as it gives a different view of SF than the usual downtown one, but it could be inconvenient for some travellers.
2474	0		Really liked the room and had no problems with noise.
1105	0		I went down to the reception
6783	0		During the rest of the day, you can also get complimentary water, coffee, tea, milk and cookies in the same area of the lobby.
6008	1		If you are looking to do downtown Seattle as a tourist you cannot do much better, in my opinion, than the Best Western Executive Inn.
6413	0		Think Hilton quality and you will be pleasantly surprised
2886	0		It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.
282	0		Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite.
1251	0		2. The pillows are awful, too soft.

6956	0		We will definately stay at our favouite Hawaiian hotel again.
5982	0		Also all doors seem to have to slam to close.
5865	0		The shuttle bus works excellent.
6859	0		We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I cant comment on those.
5558	0		However, this resort was highly unorganized and for a 6 GOLDEN Apple rating, we would surely cringe to see a 4-star ratied resort, which must be a sewer with 3 people working per every 1,000 tourists.
3874	0		The lobby was lovely to hang out in, the restaurant was very, very good.
3847	1		Also, a warning, be careful of what you sign up for as wireless internet.

4468	0		Over-all the trip was okay but a little disappointing.

5247	0		The view of the ocean and Palomino Island was breathtaking.
4433	0		We made our reservations each day at 11am for the same evening with no problems.

2670	0		To make it even better they should add robes
2540	0		and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found.

7189	0		We then returned to the hotel for one more night before heading back home.
2609	0		From what I understand we stayed in the newer renovated tower which is supposed to be much nicer than the other, older tower.
2176	0		one renovated where the kids stayed,
5832	0		The location is in the heart of Times Square and a block from Port Authority.
5523	0		In fact, of the 5 hotels we stayed at in total the Millennium Plaza was the only one which did not offer free WIFI.
7243	0		Transportation notes: there were 4 of us traveling from JFK with at least 8 bags.
7458	0		a soft drink was priced at 3Euro.
5744	0		Beautiful large rooms with a separate sitting area and desk.
3437	0		The staff was so friendly and helpful, and our room was above average, considering the norm for hotels in Europe.
6723	0		The hop on hop off tour buses also stop nearby so for us the location was ideal.
2656	0		but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling.
2461	0		I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle.
5998	0		The first room we were taken to had only a shower, and barely enough room to set down our bags.
5488	0		One thing we will remember about the room is that AC was freezing
1892	0		Definitely not 3 star material to me...
5486	0		My wife and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 3 days during October.
6135	0		This hotel reminds me of an old New York hotel.
2728	0		I've had better help at Motel 6 -- and they don't charge anything for internet or boxes.
241	0		Lobby and location is perfect.
3679	0		The internet was free but I do think people should only be allowed say 30 mins and its written in a book, thats a fair way I think.
3133	0		The fruit selection was outstanding.
2994	0		the service was great the only mistake was one day the room was not clean when I returned that afternoon

6347	0		I finally got the attention of a young gentleman ,Alex, to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties.
6259	0		Location was good for walking.
5914	0		It certainly wouldnt keep us from staying there again.

4446	0		Italian - This was good.
323	0		Turn around immediately and return to the front desk, where you will be charged an extra 30 Euros per night for a "renovated" room that, upon inspection, hasn't been renovated anytime in recent memory, but is at least cleaner and does not smell.
6548	0		The decor of the hotels public spaces and rooms is modern and sleek, featuring dark woods, light-colored walls, tile and marble bathrooms, and adjustable mood lighting.
2592	0		and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available.
6256	0		Good sized room, good location
1155	0		This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.

4435	0		They cook up beef, chicken, seafood, cut up veggies and fried rice.
4245	0		Contrary to other reviews, I found the prices at both the restaurant and the lounge to be comparable and fair considering the location of the hotel in the Financial District and the level of service and quality provided.
4904	0		Can one have a good time here and enjoy their stay as the resort is now?
3428	1		None of them appeared to be a concierge per se and noone offered to make us dinner reservations when asked about restaurants, so expect to take care of these details on your own.

6836	0		It probably needs it again.
7148	0		The decor is modern and relatively new.
2922	0		and the valet staff had their work cut out for them...
5664	0		The breakfast was very poor ,the hotel really economized here, and the coffee was very poor.
3059	0		Wild Ginger, McCormick and Schmicks, Top pot donuts, and skating along the sound helped to make it a great working vacation.

6032	0		Great Hotel My girlfriend and
3663	0		It is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location to explore Boston.

3445	0		For what we paid I have nothing to complain about, and will happily return.
278	0		The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference.
721	0		The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting.
4678	0		Thats a little too much if you ask me; overall, the city is still almost empty which is a shame.
7414	0		This place obviously has a pattern of pulling this type of scam on tourists and should be closed down
4825	1		Take our advice, stay at home, save your money if this is where you plan to vacation.
5999	0		It was not newly refurbished by any means.
6912	0		After a 30-45 min horseback ride there is a good one-hour hike through some VERY rugged terrain of narrow paths, steep hills and very rocky.

1039	0		unfortunately this hotel is extremely disappointing.
5415	0		We were upgraded from a queen to king room with a view
4305	0		Connectivity from the hotel to all important places is good as it is right in front of the main station.
84	1		Look around the same area for another hotel.
3380	0		Towels were small and very rough.
85	0		Think you can do better.
5624	1		The rooms can be a bit small but I suggest ocean view only since the other rooms face high rises and this defeats the purpose of being in a tropical setting.
6440	0		This was the third time I have stayed at this property, but this will be my last time.
1286	0		My bed was supposed to be a king
1627	0		They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds.

6678	0		Hotel is really superclean, very nice and the helpful staff is very friendly.

7140	0		The wife of the hotel owner also speaks very good english.
3961	0		Since we were tired, we ordered rooms service.

2475	0		If you don't mind spending a little, it's a great stay.
350	0		and we couldn't get it quite cool enough for comfort, (3) Rather thin towels for a luxury hotel, (4) Needless step to the beds; great for tripping on (especially for an older person such as my mother).
7248	0		There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location ,right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop, to the price, and of course the wonderful staff.
6576	0		The first room ,3rd floor, also smelled funny, as did the 3rd floor hallway and the lobby.

4214	1		Dont go crazy worrying about fancy evening wear, pack as little as possible and bring a clip for the hair.
189	0		Would not return as so much choice in Berlin but can say it's situation is ideal for walking to the sights.
5612	0		The pineapples tasted nothing like the delicious pineapples we had in Kauai the week before.
3585	0		Breakfast was very good, you could choose between coffee or tea, orange juice or cereal, fried egg, grilled bacon and baked beens, two boiled eggs or ham and tomato, and also they gave you toast with butter, jam and marmalade.
1443	0		and didn't even have a wardrobe,
4377	0		Despite very careful bookings through our agent Studylink on arrival ,late, with tired students, we found that the hotel had put us in rooms where students were expected to share beds- claiming that this was normal practice.
1869	0		The lobby and dining areas are fine.
5165	0		I struck gold with the Hotel Lungarno.
1919	0		The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up,
1717	0		However, those are the only positives.
6620	0		Why we were glad that we found this hotel was the fact that we were looking for a retreat that we could come back to after a busy day of exploring the more bustling areas of the city.
2030	0		and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower.

3725	0		Breakfast rooms were inside or outside: cereal; scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, breads, pastries, yogurt, fruit, jams, bottled water and good coffee.
1164	0		The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the famous bombed out church and the start of the K'dam,
4356	0		My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them.
7404	0		The staff were great, accomodated for everything we wanted.
6665	0		I travelled with my 3 daughters--16, 12 12.
3852	0		So, I will now have to dispute those charges since the connection was bad and I did not get access at all except for the first few mins it needed the credit card number.
3867	0		When we got to the bottom of the staircase leading to check-in the bellman could not have been nicer.
1425	0		but the area around the bath had mold growing on it.
408	0		There was an unexplained,

1276	0		but if this is not included in your hotel package stay away.
7358	0		However, how this hotel is ranked as high as it is, is a mystery.
4767	0		we were very pleased.
4080	0		First, the line to make reservations was long ,wait time ranged from 10-25 mins,.

6702	0		I am not sure I can gush enough about this fine hotel.
5287	0		Biggest complaint was the street noise especially Friday and Saturday nights.

6946	0		Hotel breakfast buffet was good value and American.
1748	0		Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour

2669	0		There was a flatscreen TV, Starbucks coffee and Bliss products in the room.
658	1		The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.
2044	0		If they are working on improving customer service , as previous reviews have stated, they have a ways to go.
2162	0		Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m.A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room,not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle
2240	0		It has always exceeded our expectations.
6064	0		Parking for $9 was the cheapest we saw on our trip.
3199	0		and the staff was astoundingly incompetent and insincere.

1557	0		If I were coming to Berlin again, I would probably find a hotel nearer the Brandenburg Gate so its more central to all sites and would be happy to pay a bit more
4817	0		The food smelled spoiled most of the time.
7325	0		After a work conference in Monterey ,avoid the Hyatt Monterey - yuck, my husband and I checked into the Omni for the weekend on the advice from two business traveler friends.

3061	0		My husband was attending a conference at the hotel
5878	0		Walking distance of Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz Ferry, and the F-Line Street car and cable cars.
1092	0		and what I am receiving.

2784	0		They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet.
7349	0		We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.
1161	0		This place is in a pretty excellent location really, right opposite the Zoo, specify a courtyard facing room if you want quiet,
6459	0		We ate at Cafe Dumonde ,dont think im spelling it correctly, but ask anyone and theyll know what your talking about,, mostly for its historic aspects.
2933	0		but I didn't have time to take advantage of it.
6520	0		It was fine.
1042	0		for instance, my door didn't even close properly - but after requesting to change rooms i found out none of them do!
4814	0		The bedding situation consisted of two twin size beds that we tried to put together but, one was higher than the other, some way to consummate a marriage?
2536	0		We decided that we would look on the bright side though and give the hotel a second chance.
2212	0		The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room.
3362	0		When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello.
4289	0		The hotel is in a convenient location, walking distance to many areas.

4590	0		Overall a good experience
2534	0		On our second Christmas trip we decided to try bidding on a hotel with priceline.com.
2718	0		On a two night stay that's a big surprise.
7034	0		We would definately recommend it.
4118	0		The Staff is simply outstanding.
5190	0		Building is impressive ,although dwarfed by surrounding financial HQs and the like, and about a 15 minute cab ride from the airport.
174	0		When we complained about the smell the staff simply told us to open the windows.
6200	0		Check in was a breeze however, I was initially given a smelly, smoked -in room facing the river.
2182	0		she had trouble sleeping.
4896	0		But for $875 taxes in, you cant complain too much.
5380	1		Ps Do the circle line boat tour to see the statue of liberty and the new york skyline it is fantastic.
4258	0		Not a huge issue but worth noting.
6574	0		The bathroom is tiny and old-fashioned but was fine for us.
4927	0		You do not have to go far to experience excellent offerings.
587	0		Be warned if you are a bit of a prude as most guests are followers of the naked spa regime!
5531	0		Resort was 98% full, which explains a lot.
1676	0		We received a very fair rate
5191	0		Staff are superb throughout the hotel.
1365	0		The single room I had was very small with a sloping roof and despite only having a small single bed, there wasn't even room for for a desk.
1939	0		I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle.
2777	0		They gave me the run around and said an opening came up.
1412	0		All the good hotels in town were completely booked out which left me the Alsterhof as my only option.
3134	0		I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice.
1713	0		Overall, I'd stay somewhere else on my next trip.
5186	0		Then when it was over and the police came the hotel manager on duty refused to remove the assailants from the property as he said they were victims too when it was apparent these heavily intoxicated people perpetrated the act.
4037	0		The hotel was sold out and I could not move to another room.
3515	0		Good location - average rooms - Great Exec Lounge
2493	0		I stayed in this hotel in November, 2005.
2435	0		I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE!
6407	0		A beautiful lagoon to take walks along.
3368	0		The hotel doesnt have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel ,pricey but fabulous,.
6288	0		but when we did eat in the Hotel we found the food and service excellent.
3627	1		The University Inn is a very good deal that I would recommend to our friends.

1277	0		Its 25Euros per person other wise.
5984	0		The loctaion was as good as it gets and overall couldnt be faulted.
4978	0		Unusual ,and Very Good, Experience
6515	0		BPappealed to me as a single parent, traveling with a teenage son.
6177	1		The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum ,recommended,.
5782	0		We didnt get to eat at the Mexican restaurant,which we heard was outstanding, because it was only open two nights we were there and we had reservations at the other two restaurants those nights.
1458	0		I couldn't have wished for a better spot.
3607	0		Im not saying this isnt a good hotel for the price and location, but I would look around before I would stay here again.
356	0		The room is average looking, with motel style bedspread and decrative pillows.
502	0		Elegant 1920's furnishings made the lobby a comfortable place to relax after museum hopping with a drink and a book while watching the world bustle by outside the window.
1645	0		It also lists as a boutique hotel which is to make it sound quaint, I guess.
7400	0		My biggest complaint was lack of service, employees looked overworked and unhappy, all areas looked understaffed.
1772	0		I would classify this property as a three star location.
2132	0		Now, the neighborhood immediately outside the door looks even safer
6476	0		This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms ,we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious,.
6668	0		We arrived early, in the rain, and came to the wrong entrance.
3003	0		Unfortunately,.
1196	0		Perhaps the hotel will try to remove the nuisance at some stage - certainly staff seemed not to care.
7347	0		The clock radio was not a CD player and it didnt pick up one station.
176	0		and others were not at all.
1298	0		Also upon check-out, they got the costs of my stay wrong, trying to charge me __�_200 more then Radisson reservations had booked the room at.
7216	0		Luckily another staff member intervened and, although he didnt tell us anything different his manner was more acceptable.
2072	0		however, the tub facet dripped continuously.
6625	0		If you are looking for a place away from the noise and action of the city this is it.
5666	0		We liked this hotel - it is not far from La Rambla and is just across the road from the Metro - Universitat stop.
155	0		This hotel is in two parts the new and the old.
5532	0		The horseback riding which is included is a joke..
6353	0		But I would start with the hotel staff.
543	0		Some previous reviewers complained about the smoke released from the Cigar bar.
4646	0		I took a walk through the hotel.
2231	0		0
5184	0		It should be ashamed to call its self a Best Western.
4992	0		It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong.
3232	0		Location was great.
4886	0		If you cant make an italian meal, dont advertise you can
877	0		Instead they told us that we were in their sister hotel for 1 night.
4211	0		We were in 1317 upper unit, directly behind the beach bar, for us that was great.
3742	0		You can have breakfast and Drinks if you do it yourself and buy the ingredients.
2178	0		Had difficulty locking the door to one room,
4653	0		Actually a standard room with a connecting door into a parlor room.
701	0		though the swimming pool was a bit short for my liking.
7126	0		We never met the infamous Storm even though the reviews on his service were the final factor in booking this hotel.
3784	0		We found the service variable, ranging from very helpful to down right rude and argumentative when we checked in having used a booking service instead of the hotels direct system.
2111	0		I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID
2254	0		I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle.
7127	0		The rooms are exceptionally clean and inviting.
7353	0		With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.
360	0		executive floor representitives are cold too.
90	0		we might not have been as unpleasantly surprised.
1230	0		20-25 minutes to Potsdamer Platz.

6033	0		The location is perfect and close to everything Boston has to offer.
3410	0		Part of the beauty of the Okura is that they *do* renovate it every few years - they just keep it the same way and I kind of like that.
1103	0		but two single mattresses had been pushed in
6903	0		We think not,a first class hotel set in a tropical paradise of luxuious gardens, white sand beaches and swaying palms filled with coconuts
2454	0		The second day, I left the tip and checked out at around noon.
2846	0		Too late!
1859	0		but this seems like the only good thing about it.
3007	0		but it was really just a huge waste of space.
873	0		So we proceeded to check in,
6594	0		The lounge area was opened and looked great - We were able to get on the internet, cook a meal and also wash some very dirty clothes.
7421	0		Location: First off, Hollywood itself isnt a real nice place to stay - its sketchy in several areas and not necessarily what many out-of-towners might picture.
406	0		The restaurant (Mark Brandenburg) was over-priced and had marginal food.
6666	0		The location was perfect--easy to get to all venues, close to the Canal bus stop, around the corner from the Anne Frank House ,go after 7 pm if you can--no line,
6692	0		Housekeeping was curteous and kept my room clean and stocked.
2215	0		The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone,
1955	0		p.s. this complaint has nothing to do with the hotel only the neighborhood,
981	0		The best thing about this hotel is the location: around the corner from the Kurfurstendam, in central Berlin, and close to lots of public transport.
6660	0		I found this hotel to be a great base, I mean who needs a luxuary hotel, when youre going to be out all day and then just need somewhere to rest your head at night?
813	0		The rooms where spacious, everything was clean and the beds are really good.
3579	0		Easter holidays and all I can say is that the place was great.
2057	0		but the traffic and street noise is very loud.
1790	0		The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime
2412	0		The hotel is very central to a lot of good shopping centres, Pike Street Market, and lot of great restaurants.
3973	0		We had a family suite for 3 adults - it was huge, comfortable and clean.
3465	0		Thier brochure and website rate this hotel as a four and half star property, but at the time of our visit it did not meet the standard of a three star property.
6672	0		The breakfast buffet was the best that we had during our trip--and we were in 8 different hotels during our stay.
1971	0		we checked into our 4th floor room and were very surprised when we opened the patio curtains only to find that we were looking directly at a cement wall about 2 feet away from the porch.
6216	0		The Westin prides itself on its Heavenly Beds and I couldnt agree more with them.
1535	0		The room in fairness was very spacious and included its own area for the wardrobe, a free to use safe, small table and chair in the middle of the floor (and a pretty stained floor at that) and a small kitchenette in the corner (although nothing is included to use with it so unless you bring your own pots, pans and cutlery I see little point in this being here).
5823	0		Oh by the way, bedrooms have a free pillow menu
2163	0		and splutterand keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlitesdecide its time to go home.
441	0		and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us.
3696	0		The first floor ,lobby, restaurant, shops, were all nicely decorated and clean.
4385	0		Nice but not for western tourists.
2336	0		I tried three rooms
5214	0		Little Gem and close to all you want to see in Madrid
5426	0		Also has a neat candy machine in the room that is a nickle for some hot tamale candy.
1550	0		The location I would say is well within walking distance to the majority of sites up to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag, beyond that you may want to choose the U-Bahn or S-Bahn instead, the nearest one being in Alexanderplatz some 5 minutes away.
938	0		and the sliding wardrobe door seemed to be just about hanging on.
5515	0		Upon check-in we were upgraded to a corner room on the 30th floor.
3549	0		You are safe and there are more than enough shops in the immediate locality for you to have a browse around.
5474	0		when we arrived we were greeted by the front staff who helped us to bring our luggages up to the lobby.
283	0		Breakfast was not included
3628	1		Watch out where you park in Seattle.
6121	0		The hotel has a Starbucks, Ruth Chris Steakhouse and The Cheesecake Factory.
2834	0		There are plenty of nice hotels in Seattle.
1169	0		The goodies in the bathroom are very high quaility.
7197	0		Unfortunately the dryers broke after I put my clothing in the washer.
3006	0		The room I received was one of the larger suites,
6418	0		We played the KoOlina golf course and it is well worth it
1942	0		We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October.
2552	0		Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel.
5065	0		you wont be disappointed.
5735	0		And quietness is worth something I think:-,
103	0		breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous
4907	0		Flight was long, and there was not much direction as to how to get to the bus.Food was great.
5829	0		After check out on our last day, they held our luggage at the hotel while we did some more sightseeing.
3486	0		Often we were not able to obtain beach towels, some days the wait was an hour, on others days the staff had no idea when more towels were coming.
4813	0		Our room was decorated with love birds made of towels and we received a small bottle of room.
42	0		Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to step out of their hotel and straight into the action,
5485	0		Nice little hotel, friendly staff
3828	0		I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel.
2897	0		Still a good meal, but still something that leaves you wanting the taste of something sweeter at the end.
801	0		two people need to take turns walking around the room.
507	0		A cigar bar off the lobby worried us until we discovered it did not offend our non-smoking sensibilities.
4993	0		We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty.
768	0		so if you don't want to pay minibar charges,
3359	0		Toiletries were below average but thats not a huge consideration for us.
2750	0		Same exact food if you are at the cafe, room service or catering a banquet.
6481	0		Outstanding
6236	0		If you want to purchase the hotel service package for $9, you receive an additional admission to the water park ,we had 4 with our room,, unlimited use of the fitness facility, miniature golf, 2-for 1 ice cream, etc.
5621	0		The restaurant on the ground level facing the beach is a bit overpriced, especially for dinner ; the service staff can be a bit surly .
5828	0		Check In is at 3 PM, however, we arrived at 10 AM and got our room right away
5212	0		Went to speak with reception and they moved me to a better room.
467	0		and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice.
6845	0		Having said that, I would go back.
782	0		it doesn't have a very clean look.
2697	0		and they didn't know.
1657	0		The front desk was very, very rude; cutting my sentences off midway to tell me that it didn't matter what I was told,
4152	0		Staff were friendly and helpful and the public areas of the hotel are stunning.
1289	0		There was no universal adapter in the room.
1672	0		It isn't that great of a location, and certainly not worth being treated as if I were pond scum because of using Hotwire (as if people who saved money were stupid).
1231	0		Alternatively it's around __�_8 in a taxi.
1179	0		We booked our stay for the Easter weekend in a standard room.
1382	0		What an unpleasant surprise!
769	1		you can go buy your own water and snacks.
6775	0		The hotel itself is very nicely designed as well.
758	0		The price was very reasonable and included daily buffet breakfast and wireless internet access.
3933	1		However if you are travelling with a laptop they provide free internet in the rooms ,decent speed ~2mbps, ask at reception for pass code.
924	0		There was a construction site next to hotel
1471	1		I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.
5642	0		Three other couples travelled with us and everyone found the hotel enchanting - and the price modest.
5903	0		Great location, perfectly nice hotel
582	0		Probably not the best view if you were staying in mid-winter but perfect in the heat of the summer.
1852	0		I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.
7322	0		Wouldnt return to New York though, thought it was just the same as any other city.
4008	0		We often observed them singing to the background music.
4249	0		This truly is a superlative property.
525	0		Recommended.
1777	0		There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel.
5489	0		But that isnt a bad thing.
3756	1		Be careful snorkeling at Red Beach.
6206	0		I came in around 5 p.m. on Friday night and checked in without any problems.
6085	0		Thanks to Del ,valet area, and Kieth ,front desk, we were taken care of.
7223	0		We booked directly through the Marriotts website many months before and secured a favorable rate using the Senior discount.
5288	1		If you do stay there and even if you dont, make sure you have dinner at House of Nanking on Kearny - excellent
1721	0		As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as
3409	0		Its not true to say that it hasnt been renovated, though.
5295	0		I didn have any problems at all.
708	0		The staff seemed nice enough and helpful.
1622	0		I was wondering what i was getting myself into.
1597	0		TAKE A PORTABLE FAN.
1144	0		What it did not have was the requested double bed; instead it had two single beds pushed together with uncomfortable mattresses and tiny duvets.
3580	0		The room was small but not tiny.
5852	0		Paradise Had a 3 night stopover and must say the hotel was brilliant.
2356	0		Well, we paid only $130
6048	0		One of the best hotels Ive ever stayed in.
5713	0		Loved Princess Bavaro, but it is not for Americans
1249	0		Sadly the hotel advertisements give the impression the aquarium is part of the hotel,
4056	0		No better place to stay in Venice.
2972	0		Our room was not cleaned properly,
6937	0		There is only one restaurant but the hotel is close to the Hollywood and Highland complex with a choice of restaurants Italian, American, Japanese and sort of French.
4091	0		We thought it was really false advertising, since a diversity of restaurants was promised.
5084	1		One word of caution - drink lots of bottled water and watch the food preparation, making sure your food has been cooked all the way.
69	0		The hotel is ideally located.
3978	0		Nice upper end place
3733	0		All roads lead to the Duomo, it is hard to escape its gravity.
1833	0		and the rooms are lovely.
779	0		I may be too crititical,
3791	0		I was a little dubious about this hotel after reading some of the reviews
4315	0		The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.
6068	0		Overall Good Value for the Money

5028	0		It was nice to finally eat at a restaurant that wasnt buffet.
6302	0		The staff was amazingly helpful, the restaurants were some of the best Ive ever been to in my life ANYWHERE
7246	0		Hotel Metro Never Fails
2010	0		but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.
5391	0		Our room had a small chair that had a swing table on the arm and a foot rest that slid out, perfect for working on the laptop.
1826	0		and we were able to walk to places,
697	0		If you are going to be making use of the fantastic public transport across Berlin, then this hotel is an ideal (though slightly expensive) base from which to explore this amazing city.
3485	0		In addition to the problem with food services at the Flamenco, we had one complete day with no running water in our room and the service at the beach left much to be desired.
5095	0		But it hasnt put me off the place, and it will definitley be our choice of hotel when we return, which I hope will not be too far away
1109	0		Was it because they thought I had got the room too cheap?,
3543	0		This was a refreshing change and something staff at the supposed super resorts in Dubai ,I have Madinat Jumeirah in Mind, should take note of.
5226	0		It was delightful - very central to everywhere.
2283	0		The rooms are simple, almost bare, and it does feel like the building has seen better days. There's no overnight parking which is my only real complaint about the place especially since parking is so dang expensive.
229	0		Really separate beds.
3083	0		The maid insisted on cleaning our room
6175	0		Easy.
4210	0		Also it really doesnt matter where your room is located, each section has its benefits.
7031	0		We choose to stay at HI Exp when we can because they are reasonably priced and include a substantial breakfast and you know exactly what youre going to get because the quality of the hotels are all very similar.
7463	0		Not so bad....
3141	0		The pool was average at best.
807	0		I had booked a quiet singleroom with a bathtub, however, when I arrived they said I will receive the familyroom, for unknown reasons.
222	0		The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase,
6386	0		Difficult to fault
3443	0		food also of a very good standard.
3596	0		Because we were traveling with a small child we needed to use the elevator which barely held myself and a child, but you still had to go up stairs to get to the elevator to Gravina II.

6305	1		If you need to get out and roam, this is not the resort for you, as you are miles away from anything, however there is so much to do right there at the resort I cant imagine why you would need to go anywhere.
3123	0		My only minuses were the bed was a little hard (but still comfy) and the additional fees for the little things...which is typical of the hotels in Seattle anyway.
3823	0		Our weekend got off to a bad start when one girl had her purse pinched on the metro ,be very careful, but the reception staff were very helpful and told us exactly what we needed to do and where the police station was.
1889	0		So we cancelled the room before we found out that there was a huge convention in town that took over all the hotels in the area,

7417	0		Convenient, solid, would stay again
5938	0		One of the most beautiful I have ever seen...
5779	0		Every night, and I mean every single night of our stay, a minimum of four of the listed restaurants were closed, and two were actually just one place named twice.

2420	0		When we got to our room, we went to use the bathroom
3118	0		The staff was professional and polite,
968	0		Yes, breakfast is a little busy, but come on folks, be patient!
1019	0		All I could be told was that as I had booked through Expedia,
2055	0		The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.
5043	0		The food is just part of the deal and it has to be expected to be a bit lower quality compared to cruise ships.
2716	0		But it's clear that the Sheraton sheds all it's normal charges in order to make the rm price look cheap --
3002	0		but it has progressively gone down hill in my opinion.
2119	0		Okay, this is NOT a glam hotel,
1110	0		it seemed a bit like that to me.
7052	0		The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros.
2585	0		and expensive breakfast buffet for $25. The pool area was poorly ventilated
1674	0		It was a real bummer staying here!

162	0		The rooms in the old part are described as Classic.
4098	0		As I booked through Carnival I assumed the hotel would be of a decent standard, Carnival should look at this part of the operation, the feel good experience should start when we get to Miami.

637	0		But otherwise it was a very interesting four days. Distances in Berlin are vast
3779	0		We had breakfast in the restuarant and it was good although there are plenty of other good restaurants and diners nearby.
598	0		Once again beware the naked berliners (conservative Irish person speaking) in the park and also the mosquitos!
4301	0		The hotel as such was good with a very good breakfast.
4499	0		The furnishings and fittings are still in good condition.
7366	0		If you plan on driving, the valet is $8 per day which is comprabable to most 4 or 5 star hotels.
3573	0		The lobby is somewhat chic and the neighborhood is a very typical Hollywood neighbor hood.
5104	0		I really enjoyed my stay here,
7367	0		Overall I had a great experience at this hotel and if needing to go back, I wouldnt mind staying at this hotel again.
2241	0		Excellent location only 2 blocks from Pike Place markets and transport.
1226	0		Based on the evidence so far, this will be a triumph of hope over experience.
1487	0		and also in the other bedrooms of the hotel where fellow Portuguese travelers stayed.
4933	0		Dave and Maxine Johnson Maine,USA
5376	0		Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed
6075	0		Watch the bartender at Tikis, they let some blond guy from Iowa charge his drinks to my tab without asking me about it.
765	0		and while they don't do room service (contrary to what the hotel information book in the room says),
5983	0		So unless you are a really early riser or a really heavy sleeper, the noise factor will be quite a problem.
907	0		Not once did they smile.
2424	0		Housekeeping did respond quickly and cleaned the entire bathroom,
4334	0		But what really sets it apart is the attentive staff and the above-and-beyond level of service and helpfulness.
1378	0		Checked into Alexander Plaza on a Friday afternoon for two nights.
1391	0		Friendly staff at reception, bar and breakfast.
1500	0		On calling the reception desk there was no apology or alternative offer given.
814	0		The bathroom was a let down,
1326	0		Never got the chance to use them though, preferring to spend our limited time on Berlin's many fascinating museums.
4889	0		I tried ordering something from their menu and gave up after repeating my order four times ,I was at the bar 10 minutes,.
3309	0		It was lovely, and looked very recently done.
7141	0		Free Internet is also provided which is great.
7344	0		We thought that was a little odd for a king room.
1137	0		The requested room was "garden view" away from the heavy traffic outside the hotel.
7329	0		The room was spacious and smelled beautiful - cant ever remember a hotel room smelling SO floral....but not overwhelming.
7275	0		1st Time at the Nikko
6187	0		I wasnt disappointed.
1062	1		Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!
2951	0		Also an easy walk to Pike Place market and the waterfront.
5582	0		Its tough to find the positives after getting so upset about this vacation.
3541	0		The duty manager spoke to me in person and advised me to go to my room whilst he sorted this out within 5 minutes I was on the phone to the hotels sub contracted doctor who advised me to travel to see him as it would be quicker and cheaper.
680	0		This swivelled about when turned on, making it difficult to stand under.
5439	0		The room was very spacious with a nice bathroom and nice amenities.
6873	0		All of it is absolutely gorgeous.
3106	0		There was a little bit if a mix-up regarding my request for a king size bed
4282	0		If it wasnt  so late at night and if I was staying more than one night I would have left.
1769	0		While there are hotels closer in downtown,
2865	0		There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular.
663	0		We had a direct view over the zoo and to the Fernsehturm.
4347	1		If youre looking for a great place to stay on the happening Left Bank, this should be your choice - you wont regret it.
1915	0		The traffic noise was incredibly loud,
2096	0		and the Moore represents fair value.
1012	0		We retrurned to the Berlin Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse to plead our case that we we were under the impression that we had booked that hotel and wanted to be there for the four nights
6578	0		Its really good to be able to walk out the back of the hotel and right onto the beach or onto the beachfront walkway for biking or rollerblading, and its rare in SoBe unless youre paying top dollar.
4265	1		If you think you are going to a American/Canadian 4-5 star resort you would be fooling yourself.
1433	0		The internet access is like a small telephone box with no seat.
3308	0		Once we had seen the picture, we were hooked and when we saw it, we knew we had made the right choice.
2970	0		I think is the month the lady at the front desk said.
4869	0		Everything else in the room was fine.
3321	0		The hotel has tables and chairs right on the Grand Canal, and a shady area to the side under two large sun shades.
3128	0		This hotel was within walking distance to most attractions (the Space Needle has a monorail a couple of blocks away)
4552	0		Quality was not very special and no flavour.
6889	0		Not big with the young, single crowd.
1698	0		but a little walking will get you to the main tourist spots.
1000	0		If not, stay away.
4893	0		I skipped out, but only because we ran out of time.
4910	0		Only neg was no one served drinks at the pool.
260	0		My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced.
7528	0		Trips: Only took one trip...Saona Island...This island is breathtaking...a must see.
232	0		I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room.
2546	0		but I was still very disappointed with the floor that we stayed on
3692	0		Pretty Nice
5568	0		it was so bad some other guests who walked by my husband commented, Hey, we saw you get up and get our own drinks and we were going to ask you to get ours, haha, since you are a better server than anyone working here..
5595	0		We checked out the first thing the next morning and went to the Hyatt which was wonderful.
3748	0		The bathroom was sufficient and for the most part clean.
6426	0		My business trip coincided with a 40,000 person convention and a marathon, so the stay was during a peak weekend and I was lucky to find the room for under $200.
2430	0		There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either.
317	0		Let's have a round of applause, please, for the Westin Grand, for taking discount bookings to a new low.
2684	0		Especially for the price.
6072	0		Nice seating options at the pool, nice lounging areas, relaxing.
5300	0		We loved Dukes Resturant.
884	0		We had a small fridge with a mini bar, which had a selection of 6 drinks.
7452	0		Our room had air conditioning, a small tv in the closet, hair dryer, and a small desk with chair.
7233	0		The rooms were clean and comfortable and good sized.
6647	0		They will match or beat the best online rate.
819	0		Even with the window shut you could hear trafficnoise all through the night.
835	0		but I heard this is typical german,
4456	0		No garbage cans to be seen around the beach.
837	0		For 88 euros a night (double room), this hotel is an excellent value.
3352	0		Great value in Seattle
678	0		but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment.
4935	0		True, the location is very convenient to the central shopping district and the staff are mostly courteous.
2144	0		I once left a drawerfull of clothes behind
5121	0		It was also pretty cold.
492	0		They have a wonderful hot breakfast buffet that was included in our stay,
4017	0		People constantly walked the beach-about 10% of the women are topless.
2360	0		and it was a good deal.
6307	1		They wanted over $300 for 4 days, and we ended up renting at Enterprise for about $125 insurance included , after driving in Puerto Rico I highly recommend taking there insurance,.
3558	0		I should have posted reviews about the Atlantis Bahamas, Loewes Miami beach, Mina A Salam Dubai, Westin Times Square New York, numerous eastern shangri las.
5732	1		If you like quietness, as I do, ask for a room at the backside not fasing the street and higher up.
2232	1		5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough.
1426	0		I pointed this out to both the reception and the cleaning staff.
1260	0		Would not stay again.
7003	0		Who could ask for more?
988	0		I don't recall Expedia (with whom I booked) asking if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room, so I felt I didn't have arguments to change.
2523	0		but he never returned my call.
3107	0		but the management ended up upgrading me to a corner room (larger room, HDTV, king bed) and didn't charge us.
1201	0		but as the place isn't cheap to begin with and it claims to be 5 star why the difference between this and other 5 star operations in Berlin?
2382	0		We were surprised and disappointed at the condition of our room.
94	0		There were only two treadmills (one of which was broken), a Lifecycle bike, and four computerized weight machines.
1469	0		and the staff were pleasant and helpful.
6269	0		One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE
3714	0		We enjoyed this hotel and its location very much.
925	0		but there were no annoying noise, at least to our ears.
3951	1		I would highly reccommend a hotel called The Phoenix over this place.
5818	0		Fantastic hotel - will be going back asap
3361	0		I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg ,after Olympic Penninsula, but decided to cancel the second reservation.
370	0		The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.
6234	0		We ate from the pool food/bar which was fine, and then at the Hole in the Wall for dinner and then breakfast.
3577	0		There is a Subway Starbucks store over the road which is very handy.
1934	0		but the food was OK
5444	0		Bathroom updated nice.
377	0		and bathroom was typical smallish hotel fare.
3399	0		The check-out from the room is just as easy as the check-in.
1182	0		and it has the unfortunate disadvantage of constantly crowding the lobby with passing pedestrians having a free look from the hotel side.
2246	0		It is in a great location - close to Pike Place Market
5559	0		We have been to Mexico many times, other areas as well, and have never experienced such horrendous service and apathy.
5790	0		The only problem we had was one room had a very loud buzzing during the night ,room 505, apparently it was to do with it being above the restaurant, however as soon as we mentioned it to reception, we were immediately moved without fuss to a suite
4309	0		The Ilikai also permanently closed one of their two pools because the adjacent ,Yacht Harbor, tower was sold to another company.
6911	0		If you go on the Quervo Fun Fun cave tour, it is not for the faint of heart
3136	0		Treadmills were in very bad need of repair.
4244	0		Yet, being far enough away from the hectic activity of these places -- especially during this time of year -- made the hotel room a welcome refuge.
2957	0		We checked out the pool
1528	0		Inside though is a bit better, checking in was quick
1320	0		When we presented our pre-paid reservation through Expedia at the check-in desk, we were told that it wasn't registered.
896	0		After about 15 minutes we re-approached the receptionist as nobody came out to see us, and were told that there was nothing they could do, despite it being their error.
6149	0		The Aveda products were also a nice surprise
4296	0		It was included in my room rate.
115	0		My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB).
2224	0		Very nice, but in the morning you have the traffic.
5020	0		The crepes were my favourite part of breakfast.
1972	0		No view at all.
6868	0		We didnt always get there early or leave towels on the chairs and we were still able to find palapa covered seating, it just would take a lil bit of walking back and forth and possibly sitting in an area too far from the water or the bar.
4178	0		We had a room facing Magazine street which had 18ft ceilings and windows to match - beautiful.
2617	0		The ones we went to seemed to be quite upscale so even the food court can be a bit pricey given the type of food served.
5592	0		They move us a third time, this room was small but it appeared to have working heat and air.
1731	0		We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell.
2012	1		but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).
7130	0		We had no trouble getting anywhere we wanted to go because of the exceptional concergie service.
5209	0		Great Location- ok hotel
1784	0		although not the type I reserved.
4570	0		$85 + parking was better than I was expecting.
1066	0		we were really looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel.
3555	1		You can also use the star ferry, pennies, on the Kowloon side which will drop you island side adjacent to harbour city mall which is a good spot to take the classic harbour panoramic photo.
6186	0		I stayed in this Novotel because 1- it is relatively cheap, 2 - of the brand Novotel.
2369	0		but when we turned on the fan it was even louder
1562	0		Arrived pretty late for our 4 night stay, because of flight delay.
3304	0		Pool is a bit small but adequate, the gym well equipped but not used much.
6469	0		great place for tourists
3551	0		Its only 60-80 HKD to the Wan Chai bars and central.
918	0		Late review for Berlin Markt.
3479	0		We reported this incident immediately to guest services at the hotel, but there was no further response from the hotel.
7284	0		My room had a 42 inch plasma t.v. which was nice.
6178	1		The dessert place was very good as well ,also recommended,.
616	1		You must use these or risk breaking your leg.
2264	0		I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking,
2735	0		I have had much more consistent and better visits at Hiltons lately.
6507	0		Evidently Leo Dicaprios favorite haunt when he stays in New York.
6462	0		Yes, i know its a chain restaurant that you can find in a lot of different states, but something about the one in the French Quarter just tastes better.
7268	0		Go with an open mind, relax, and you will have an absolutely great time.
4614	0		Dont get me started.
5085	0		We found the staff to be friendly and plenty of activities for everyone in our group to enjoy.
2070	0		The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning.
6453	1		Crown Plaza is fine, but beware of parking prices
7476	0		I am not sure that this is the fault of the hotel though.
1730	0		It smelled like mold and mildew.
4581	0		Our first room had a small kitchenette, the second did not -- here, a micro wave and a small fridge would have been welcome.
840	0		clean and had a nice view down to the road.
2248	0		If you like luxury, you may be disappointed, but was lucky enough to get a room with a waterfront view
3120	0		The place was spotless, even with a convention going on.
3830	0		Our minibus which the hotel booked for us returning to the airport only cost 55 euros between 6 of us.
515	0		while the location was great.
3001	0		I used to really enjoy it,
2054	0		If you approach from Lenora St, however, you have to make two lefts to get to the garage which is to the left of the lobby.
4236	0		Plaza III is pricey, but well worth the money
2417	0		Check in went smoothly,
4733	0		we paid extra for the wedding package, room upgrade and the excellence club, it was money well spent.
5193	0		And the ridiculously overpriced spa where she had a number of treatments, all preceded by the ringing of a small bell.
3994	0		While not bad for families looking to save a little, it is not the luxurious resort for which it bills itself.
2019	0		In fact there was one member of the staff who was outright rude.
1483	0		and I think they never changed the towels.
5367	0		On return to our room one evening there was a note from Engineering with a box of Godiva chocolates, telling us that they had carried out repairs and apologizing for the inconvenience.
5471	0		Our room is spacious with internet access, cozy modern-minimalis design and clean.
4048	0		I cannot stop the hot water coming out from the machine.
6535	0		,By the way,The same can be said for Sofitel Water Tower,
5487	0		The room was clean and well maintained.
5227	0		The room we stayed in was large and airy and i loved coming back to the room each night to find the bed turned down and two mini toblerones on each pillow.
2194	0		The next morning we saw another bed bug crawling around on the wall next to the bed we just slept in.
4908	0		Room was excellent, we requested to be close to the beach so we were abit far away from everything else.
695	0		The hotel is situated in the only area of the city that has not seen major redevelopment in the past 20 years.
5473	0		Guests must climb with luggage.
1128	0		On the day of our return, with time on our hands, we decided to take the train to the airport and were advised by the bell captain to go via Bundes Platz to Schoenefeld.
4113	0		This was our second time at this resort and we enjoyed iteven more than the first time
321	0		you come to the end of a regular-looking hotel corridor, pass through a lounge, and into a narrow, dark and musty corridor with doorways just about your height and barely wide enough to fit your carry-on luggage ... well,
5655	0		Receptionist superb and really helpful.
3689	0		It is perhaps a bit old fashioned but very comfortable.
2713	0		It is just like being at that job you were trying to get away from.
57	0		I have searched for the design,
3544	0		Truly truly gob smacking pioneering customer service with little touches everywhere, amazing gracious service.
4051	0		The cafe downstairs is terrible, decoration is bad and smelly.
1038	0		but the late night atmosphere for couples was romantic and welcoming - see as much as you can Berlin it is a lovely city - we will return - different hotel though!
89	0		Had we not been told in advance how wonderful our stay would be because of the Heavenly Beds,
858	0		This hotel is located just off the kurfurstendam str, which is the main shopping street in Berlin.
2479	0		but it may cost to connect in the room.
2082	0		but we decided to add a couple of extra days to see Seattle.
4417	0		When we first checked in, we were given room 2403 ,Block 2, 4th floor, which is right by the front desk.
7000	0		We arrived at the hotel at 12pm, Eveyln at check in was very helpful but advised that only a room with a king size bed was available.
6281	0		Because the Hotel made a great visit to New York even better.
517	0		Enjoyed the hospitality and helpfulness of the Savoy Berlin staff.
3408	0		Its like stepping into my nans living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture.
226	0		I felt I was walking through a sewer.
7192	0		The rooms are nice with some cute modern finishes.
4748	0		The hotel itself was interesting since it is round, the staff were polite but the hotel itself is understaffed.
1566	0		and perhaps a little more 'sensitive' than I should be.
1083	0		Upon check-in, I was shocked at the room we received -- very stripped-down.
7266	0		There are people working all over the hotel 24/7, gardening and keeping it clean.
30	0		Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify!
6958	0		Overall we had a good experience.
572	0		The only option was to have the window open all of the time which made sleeping impossible due to noise from the street below.
5995	0		It was a little pricier but so worth it if you are into views.
4333	0		Location is great; the rooms are comfortable; the amenities ,morning paper, free wine in the evening, high-speed internet, are perfectly lovely; the adjoining restaurant great for breakfast ,I didnt eat dinner there, but it looked filled up when I stuck my head in,; the New Yorker magazine theme in the lobby and the library fun.
2854	0		I might try the Seattle Sheraton after the construction
3919	0		I then asked the housekeeper if she could give me 5 minutes, because I was on my way out and she said yes.
6314	0		Oh yeah, Donald Trump is building a couple hundred condos on the same property as the resort ,Dont worry, you dont even know the construction is going on, this place encompasses over 2000 acres,, and Trump also has two 18 hole golf courses ,PGA tour 2008-2011, on the property.
3593	0		My husband and I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and besides the location were not all that impressed.
4403	0		Front doors of rooms are old, not very energy efficient or sound proofed.
3917	0		When she noticed I was there she ran out of the room.
76	0		Room was nice but does need to be vacuumed more frequently than ours was..
2987	0		and the staff have always been professional and courteous.
3277	0		Overall if you stay at the lenox you will not be disappointed
5728	0		In no way do I mean any disrespect to anybody, and if anybody fells disrespected, I apoligize from the bottom of my heart.
4213	0		Also it was verrry HOT.
2819	0		and service it is right downtown convenient for walking.
3177	0		but the Dahlia Lounge directly opposite is fantastic.
4467	0		We did not frequent the bars so did not tip when we went up for the odd drink.
1569	0		Opened bathroom door and stepped back from 'strange' smell,
4929	0		Overall a very good hotel and efficient front desk staff who had good English speaking skills.
233	0		Then you enter the bathroom.
2711	0		So after all that, no pool, hot tub or gym.
6240	0		Everything about the place is warm, no regular upstarts telling you to get in line.
4597	0		Yes, this is a beautiful hotel, but aside from that there is nothing.
1114	0		they gave me the keys of a decent room.
880	0		After about ten minutes of lugging our luggage around we found an old building which later we found was the sister hotel.
2803	0		Regardless, there are a few good things to mention.
3038	0		I would stay here again - particularly once the pool reopens ;)!
2385	0		The bathtub had moldy/dirty caulking,the mattress cover was not fitted and rolled up all night to the point of being very uncomfortable.
2776	0		I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called.
698	1		The Restaurants in the hotel are okay, though if not eating in the hotel I would advise you to look further a field as the restaurants/caf�_�_��_s close by are not particularly good.
6745	0		The bathroom was clean and nice.
2033	0		So with the window also came all the city noise.
7065	0		Beach and pool area topless.
382	0		the concierge that we went to see about finding a laundry mat was a bit of pain in the rear,
4083	0		We ended up getting a reservation at La Uva, for Wed night at 6pm ,oh well,, but we did not get another reservation the rest of the week.
2134	0		Best part - YOU ARE ONLY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE WATERFRONT.
4501	0		I was a little taken aback too when one of the bath towels that I wanted to use had 5 holes on it.
1485	0		The bathroom have a open sewer of a kind, next to the bathtub that exhales the most noxious odor.
2737	0		It was the highlight of this trip.
913	0		Plenty of TV channels in many languages.
853	0		HI We have stayed in this hotel twice and are staying again later this year, for the value its great is this hotel,
3000	0		I've stayed at the Sheraton Seattle numerous times on business over the last 3 years.
4131	0		The beer was good.
5856	0		Staff were helpful but the breakfasts were a bit expensive.
4182	1		All very good - only dont expect to be waited on .
5630	0		Gorgeous Hotel, Amazing View, A Little
3058	0		Dinner at the Space Needle as the sunset was a splurge, but well worth it.
6557	0		From the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers --- we felt like we were among Ohana ,Hawaiian for family,.
3608	0		Great Location and really clean
978	1		Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................
7161	0		This hotel is highly regarded on tripadvisor and this is why we were happy to secure a booking for a late March weekend.
623	0		that it hardly matters where you stay in the city-
6995	0		The Beach and pool area had bugs that bit me but didnt bother anybody else in our group.
2584	0		and coffee cups were dirty,
3518	0		The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect.
7078	0		We are then brought to another room garden view with 2 small beds, not acceptable for $100.00 a day.
1707	0		There was also problems with getting a late checkout - because our flight out was at 6pm,
4440	1		Brazilian - I would recommend this.
4454	0		Resort does not take care of its beach though.
258	0		A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,
2642	0		there were no robes.
585	0		A turn down service also added a little more luxury.
5096	0		Very good experience
6442	0		The last time they gave us a room that had been made up to look clean, but actually had dirty sheets and a bathroom that had been used.
2948	0		Our room was on the 25th floor and was quite nice.
1031	0		Thank goodness there are plenty of alternative hotels for future visits and for us to recommend to others.
3068	0		The bathroom was cramped compared to what the Alexis offered,
6954	0		We had our three children in a room next door to us and it was a truely magical experience for them.
7245	0		Our doorman, Nick, arranged our transportation to the port and that was $25 plus tip.
6860	0		As for the others, the food was okay.
4839	0		The hotel was nice enough - beautiful gardens, lovely pool, nice rooms ,but annoyingly damp - all the bedding smelled damp which was very unplesant,, but Nusa Dua itself was a dreadful disappointment.
1745	0		and consequently arose an hour late.
1224	0		and secondly failed to send me any kind of confirmation.
1899	0		We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony.
