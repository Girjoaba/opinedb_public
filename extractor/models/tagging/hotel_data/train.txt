friendly I-OP

Lot O
of O
good O
things O
in O
the O
bazar O

The O
hotel O
restraunt B-AS
food I-AS
is O
quite B-OP
average I-OP
and O
extremely B-OP
overpriced I-OP
plenty O
of O
other O
restraunts O
and O
takeaway O
places B-AS
within B-OP
walking I-OP
distance I-OP
though O
so O
not O
a O
huge O
issue O

The O
hotel B-AS
was O
central B-OP
with O
nice B-OP
breakfast B-AS
and O
24 O
hour O
consierge O

Bed B-AS
comfortable B-OP
although O
the O
superior O
room O
had O
twin O
beds O
together O
that O
didnt O
stay O
together O
causing O
a O
gap O

The O
location B-AS
feels O
a O
little O
too O
far B-OP
from I-OP
the I-OP
town I-OP
centre I-OP
but O
everything B-AS
else O
is O
amazing I-OP

The O
bed B-AS
was O
super B-OP
comfy I-OP
and O
the O
thermostat B-AS
meant O
you O
could O
easily B-OP
warm I-OP
up I-OP
cool B-OP
down I-OP
the O
room O

I O
wondered O
why O
he O
did O
not O
go O
and O
get O
them O
for O
us O

Location B-AS
was O
fantastic B-OP

Staff B-AS
was O
very B-OP
attentive I-OP
from O
arrival O
through O
departure O

excellent B-OP
location B-AS
5 B-OP
minutes I-OP
from I-OP
central B-AS
station I-AS
15 B-OP
minutes I-OP
from I-OP
airport B-AS
lovely B-OP
to I-OP
get B-AS
away I-AS
from O
hussle O
and O
bussle O
of O
city O
life O
for O
a O
good B-OP
night B-AS
s I-AS
sleep I-AS

So O
very B-OP
good I-OP
to O
sleep B-AS
there O
in O
the O
first O
or O
last O
night O
of O
your O
vacation O

Far B-OP
from I-OP
restaurants B-AS
and O
shopping B-AS
expensive B-OP
by O
taxi O

Extremely B-OP
nice I-OP
staff B-AS
with O
very B-OP
good I-OP

English B-AS
skills I-AS

Its O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
no O
ware O

They O
charge B-OP
for O
parking B-AS
on O
their O
premises O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
its O
far O
to O
any O
civilisation O

I O
m O
disgusted O
that O
the O
hotel O
has O
such O
comfy B-OP
beds B-AS
and O

I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
full O
nights O
sleep O

Crazy O

The O
breakfast B-AS
was O
very B-OP
good I-OP

Everything O
This O
place B-AS
was O
mind B-OP
blowing I-OP

Such O
a O
beautiful B-OP
hotel B-AS
with O
amazing B-OP
rooms B-AS

The O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
was O
fantastic B-OP
in O
particular O
the O
breakfast O

t O
it O
nice O
if O
we O
were O
treated O
in O
a O
better O
attitude O
and O
if O
the O
upgrade B-AS
was O
not B-OP
existed I-OP

so O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
bus O
instead O
and O
the O
hotel O
was O
only O
about O
a O
5 B-OP
minute I-OP
bus B-AS
ride I-AS
away O
from O
city O
center O

The O
bed B-AS
was O
very B-OP
comfortable I-OP

We O
started O
to O
notice O
the O
poor O
workmanship O
throughout O
the O
building B-OP
tiling O
painting O
wallpaper O
etc O
just O
not B-OP
finished I-OP
off I-OP
like O
they O
were O
in O
a O
hurry O

Our O
room O
was O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
above O
the O
outside O
bar O
so O
noise B-AS
and O
smoke B-AS
were O
a O
problem B-OP
at O
night O

We O
have O
spent O
4 O
weeks O
in O

Europe O
and O
this O
place B-AS
was O
the O
most B-OP
disappointing I-OP

The O
location B-AS
was O
great B-OP

Right B-OP
in I-OP
the O
city B-AS
center I-AS

Many B-OP
restaurants B-AS
are O
near O
by O
the O
hotel O
and O
museums O

Had O
to O
insist O
on O
moving O
rooms O
as O
room B-AS
was O
dirty B-OP
e O
g O
mould O
on O
walls O
and O
shower O
curtain O
the O
final O
room B-AS
was O
just O
about O
acceptable B-OP
but O
did O
not O
deserve O
a O
4 O
star O
rating O
and O
was O
very B-OP
overpriced I-OP

Very B-OP
clean I-OP
location B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP

With O
one O
exception O
reception B-AS
staff I-AS
poor B-OP
Geraldo O
and O
Jasper O
poor O

I O
showed O
them O
the O
email O
confirmation O
of O
the O
revised O
booking O
on O
my O
phone O
and O
they O
asked O
me O
to O
forward O
to O
them O
before O
they O
reluctantly O
took O
off O
the O
charge O

They O
were O
the O
best O

Good B-OP
food B-AS
at I-AS
breakfast I-AS
and O
dinner I-AS

Executive B-AS
Lounge I-AS
is O
nice B-OP
touch I-OP

Nice B-OP
rooms B-AS

I O
would O
classify O
it O
as O
a O
3 O
star O
instead O
of O
four O
stars O
for O
expectation O
management O

Nice B-OP
hotel B-AS
nice B-OP
services B-AS
nice O

It O
does O
sit O
on O
a O
tram B-AS
line I-AS
literally O
across B-OP
the I-OP
street I-OP
so O
access B-AS
to I-AS

Amsterdam I-AS
was O
fast B-OP
and O
easy B-OP

Also O
because O
it O
was O
away B-OP
from I-OP
downtown B-AS
a O
little O
bit O

It O
was O
an O
okay B-OP
hotel B-AS
but O
there O
are O
better O
for O
the O
money O

R O
epitome O
staff B-AS
extremely B-OP
pleasant I-OP
and O
helpful B-OP

so O
convenient B-OP

Breakfast B-AS
is O
a O
relaxed B-OP
uncomplicated I-OP
experience B-AS
waiters O
don O
t O
hover O
around O
eyeing O
you O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
re O
even O
allowed O
to O
have O
breakfast O

Also O
the O
pantry O
is O
such O
a O
nice B-OP
touch B-AS

Loved B-OP
this O
hotel B-AS

Small B-OP
room B-AS
sloped B-OP
roof B-AS
light I-AS
shining I-AS
in O
poor B-OP
blind B-AS
and O
curtains O

Carpet B-AS
pretty B-OP
stained I-OP
and O
just O
seems B-OP
tired I-OP

Most O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
were O
amazing B-OP
but O
experienced B-OP
an O
incident O
where O
service O
was O
somewhat O
sub O
par O
in O
the O
bar O
and O
this O
is O
why O

I O
did O
not O
give O
staff O
perfect O
score O

I O
asked O
for O
blankets O
for O
outside O
and O
the O
bar O
tender O
told O
me O
he O
just O
put O
them O
away O

The O
view B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP

Staff B-AS
were O
freindly B-OP

Very B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
professional B-OP
staff B-AS
especially O
people O
in O
the O
reception O

It O
was O
about B-OP
300 I-OP
meters I-OP
to I-OP
the O
tram B-AS
and O
the O
bus B-AS

so O
we O
had O
to O
prop O
it O

The O
hotel O
itself O
is O
in O
a O
building O
that O
also O
has O
other O
residents O
a O
dental O
practice O
some O
kids O
facility O
etc O

Identifying O
the O
reception O
for O
the O
hotel O
which O
was O
in O
the O
4th O
floor O
itself O
was O
an O
achievement O

I O
would O
happily O
have O
stayed O
at O
the O
less O
expensive O
alternative O
for O
the O
whole O
stay O
in O
order O
not O
to O
have O
changed O
room O

Bed B-AS
was O
to O
soft B-OP
Cleanness O
not O
100 O
given O
especially O
on O
the O
balcony O

Price O
to O
high O
if O
you O
consider O
cleanness O
of O
bathroom O
balcony O
and O
the O
position O
of O
hotel O
outside O
of O

Amsterdam O
Downtown O
Didn O
t O
try O
breakfast O
because O
of O
high B-OP
price B-AS
better O
eat O
in O

Amsterdam O
Downtown O

The O
bed B-AS
was O
comfy B-OP
and O
the O
room B-AS
has O
plenty B-OP
of I-OP
natural B-AS
light I-AS
and O
space B-AS

Style O
of O
hotel O
reastaurant O
and O
bar B-AS
were O
fantastic B-OP

Staff B-AS
went O
above O
and O
beyond B-OP

Extremely I-OP
helpful I-OP
and O
friendly B-OP

After O
being O
seated O
in O
the O
hotel O
s O
cafe O
we O
had O
to O
wait B-AS
over O
20 B-OP
minutes I-OP
for O
a O
waiter O
to O
take O
our O
drinks O
order O

The O
reception B-AS
staff I-AS
were O
friendly B-OP
but O
were O
not B-OP
very I-OP
efficient I-OP
either O

The O
breakfast B-AS
was O
also O
very B-OP
expensive I-OP
even O
though O
there O
was O
not B-OP
much I-OP
choice I-OP

Lovely B-OP
staff B-AS
very B-OP
helpful I-OP

Room B-AS
is O
too B-OP
small I-OP

In O
an O
area O
that O
is O
more O
neighborly O
than O
touristy O

Worth O
going O
to O
Concertblow O
for O
a O
concert O

I O
am O
putting O
this O
in O

that O
s O
not O
to O
say O
that O

I O
didn O
t O
like O
the O
location B-AS
but O
that O
you O

about O

in O

Amsterdam O
Glad O

My O

t I-OP
comfortable I-OP

a O

stay B-AS
since O
the O

The O
location B-AS
was O
perfect B-OP
we O
loved B-OP
the O

beside O
the O
hotel O
very B-OP
nice I-OP
spot B-AS
to O

me O
out O

and O
stressed O

No B-OP
shops B-AS
nearby O
to O
buy O

The O
location O
is O
my O
main O
concern O
then O
the O

is O
outdated B-OP

The O
curtain B-AS
is O

Not O
all O

with O
the O

though O
only O
a O
few O
do O

The O
upside O
though O
is O
that O
this O

is O
more B-OP
spacious I-OP
compared O
to O
the O
one O
in O
another O
room O
we O

we O
booked O
the O

Decoration B-AS
of O
the O

poor I-OP

the O
breakfast B-AS
could O
have O
been O
better B-OP

Also O
price B-AS
quality I-AS
ratio I-AS
was O
poor B-OP
since O
the O
demand O
for O

Amsterdam O
hotels O
were O
high O
at O
that O
time O

The O
location B-AS
was O

and O

The O

The O

good B-OP
location B-AS

And O
it O
could O
have O
been O
easily O
avoided O
if O
they O
had O
mentioned O
the O
issue O
upon O
check O
in O

The O
price B-AS
is O
a B-OP
bit I-OP
expensive I-OP
comparing O

We O
really O
appreciated O
Ava O
and O

Leo O

We O
overlooked B-OP
the O

the O

and O
the O
city O

Room B-AS
was O
huge B-OP
but O
had O
an O
awkward B-OP
layout B-AS

Location O
Some O
effort O
to O
walk O
to O

from O
the O

stop O
but O
we O
didn O
t O
mind O

Wow O
what B-OP
a I-OP
place B-AS

I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
we O
will O
ever O
be O
able O

after O
staying O
here O

The O

so O
lots O
of O
boxes O

So O
I O

We O
were O

anything O
one O

Parking B-AS

Little O

mot O
much O

The O
sink O
was O
an O

that O

you O
couldn O
t O
run O
a O
sink B-AS
full O
of O
water O
you O
could O
only O
run O
the O

wasteful O
and O
it O
was O
poorly B-OP

so O

The O

breakfast B-OP

the O

to O
go O

go O
to O

Room B-AS

be O
a O
good O
idea O
the O
food B-AS
in O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
very B-OP
limited I-OP
and O
not B-OP
very I-OP
good I-OP
which O
was O
a O
problem O
because O
there O
is O
no O
where O

The O

idea I-OP

he O

Of O

we O

he O
looked O
at O
us O
as O
if O

A O

booking O

I O
have O
requested O
if O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
upgrade O
to O
a O

with O

The O
reply O
from O
the O
hotel O
was O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
arrange O
but O
can O
not O
guarantee O

We O
have O
arrived O
early O
the O
check O
in O
day O
around O
9:00 AM O
informed O
by O
the O

that O
we O
have O
been O
upgraded O
for O

to O
an O
executive O
room O
which O
is O

We O

Good B-OP

separate O

to O
the O

which O
was O
very B-OP
small I-OP

Room O
was O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
hotel O
backing O
into O
a O
noisy B-OP
and O
busy B-OP
room B-AS
but O
this O
did O
not O
distract O
from O
our O
stay O
would O
stay O
here O
again O

The O
rooms B-AS
were O
not B-OP
great I-OP
but O
not B-OP
bad I-OP
either O

The O
bathroom O
did O
not B-OP
have I-OP
a O
lock B-AS

The O
view B-AS
to I-AS
the I-AS
canal I-AS
was O
very B-OP
nice I-OP

The O

the O

I O
didn O
t O
like O
that O
the O

than O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O

The O

In O

Unfortunately O

we O
didn O
t O

I O
would O
recommend O
renting O
the O

you O
can O
do O
this O
from O
the O
reception O
and O
cycling O
up O
the O

One O
minor O
drawback O
here O
is O
that O
fellow O

seem O
to O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
close O
their O
room O
doors O
quietly O

No B-OP
armchair B-AS
in O
the O

there O
would O
be O
enough O

reserved O

The O

dirty B-OP
and O
the O

We O
had O

The O

our O

The O

when O

I O
was O
asked O
to O
pay O
600 O

save O

the O

and O
go O
elsewhere O

The O

were O
so O
friendly B-OP

accomodating B-OP

For O
the O
3 O

A B-OP

The O

it O
didn O
t O
get O
the O

Other O
than O
that O
the O

fine O

Ended O
up O
paying O

tiny B-OP
Elevator B-AS

Earlier B-OP
check B-AS
in I-AS
would O
help O

I O
think O
when O
a O
hotel O
advertises B-AS
pool I-OP
and O
saunas B-AS
these O
should O
be O
included O
in O
the O
price O
otherwise O
they O
can O
not O
really O
be O
considered O
a O
hotel O
facility O
you O
might O
as O
well O
use O
a O
full O
wellness O
place O
like O
Sauna O
Deco O
which O
we O
did O

Pool O
was O
included O
but O
there O
was O
a O
cost O
to O

The O

the O
comfortable B-OP

the O

I O
m O
very O
shocked O
that O
the O
shower O
was O
in O
the O
middle O

the O

I O
assumed O
that O
it O
was O
just O
advertisement O
and O
they O
would O
have O
normal O
bathrooms O
but O
apparently O
not O

This O
really O
made O
me O
feel O
uncomfortable O
as O

I O
had O
to O
shower O
in O

of O
my O
partner O

no B-OP

I O
just O
can O
t O
believe O
they O
would O
even O
build O
a O
hotel O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes O
away O
from O
the O

I O
also O
feel O
like O

I O
need O
to O
blame O
the O
hotel O
for O
the O
smell O
of O
marijuana O
in O
the O
city O
as O

I O
have O
no O
one O
else O
to O
blame O
for O
that O

The O
assistant B-AS
manager I-AS
was O
extremely B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
took B-OP
care I-OP
of I-OP
us I-OP
and O
our O
issues O
with O
the O
room O
was O
given O
at O
the O
beginning O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
cool B-OP
helpful B-OP

The O
rooms B-AS
and O
the O
common B-AS
areas I-AS
were O
all O
very B-OP
Instagram I-OP
worthy I-OP

The O
metro B-AS

the O
tram B-AS
were O
only B-OP
two I-OP
minute I-OP
away I-OP
and O
it O
felt B-AS
really O
safe B-OP
to O
ride O
the O
metro O
even O
during O
the O
evening O

We O
re O
coming O
back O

Lovely B-OP
hotel B-AS
with O
really O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS

We O
were O
checked O
in O
in O
a O
downgrade O
room O
and O
not O
the O
type O
of O
room O

Staff B-AS
were O
extremely B-OP
helpful I-OP

The O
location B-AS
is O
terrible B-OP

Breakfast B-AS
was O
a O
disaster B-OP

The O
service B-AS
staff I-AS
were O
inattentive B-OP
rude I-OP
and O
really O
not B-OP
interested I-OP
to O
make O
the O
experience O
an O
enjoyable O
one O

Not O
at O
all O
what O
one O
expects O
from O
a O
5 O

It O
was O
as O
if O
they O
were O
intended O
for O
twin O
beds O
which O
is O
what O
it O
ended O
up O
feeling O
like O

The O
second O
is O
regarding O
the O
shower O
gel O

The O
hotel O
provides O
a O
dispenser O
on O
the O
wall O
in O
the O
shower O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
separate O
single O
use O
bottle O

I O
have O
only O
ever O
seen O
this O
been O
done O
in O
the O
Ibis O
hotels O
so O
it O
came O
across O
as O
cheap O
and O
not O
what O

I O
would O
have O
expected O
from O
a O
4 O
star O
hotel O

I O
do O
however O
see O
the O
argument O
that O
this O
method O
of O
dispensing O
the O
shower O
gel O
is O
more O
environmental O
which O
is O
why O

I O
would O
not O
complain O
about O
it O

Although O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
the O
experience O
of O
riding O
bikes O
to O
city O
center O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
cold O
for O
us O

t O
think O
they O
own O
a O
vacuum O
cleaner O
as O
carpets B-AS
throughout O
the O
building O
were O
very B-OP
dirty I-OP

Beautiful B-OP
