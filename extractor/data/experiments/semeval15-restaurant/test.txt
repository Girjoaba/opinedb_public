a O
very O
nice O
time O
. O

The O

attentive B-OP
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O

the O

of I-AS
the I-AS
city I-AS

great B-OP
. O

Great B-OP
place B-AS
to O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-AS
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

Place B-AS
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O
dress O
code O
. O

Good B-OP
food B-AS
: O
my O
favorite B-OP
is O
the O
seafood B-AS
spaghetti I-AS
. O

Highly O

Excellent B-OP
food B-AS

great O
prices O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O

this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
courteous B-OP
and O
accomodating B-OP
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
limited B-OP
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
- O
1 O
hour O
, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious B-OP
indo-chinese B-AS
food I-AS
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of O
. O

the O
bestt O

my O
favorite B-OP
place B-AS

love B-OP
their O
chicken B-AS

name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good B-OP

its O
alright O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical B-OP
about O
this O
place B-AS
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun B-OP
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

lobster B-AS
was O
good B-OP
, O
nothing O
spectacular B-OP
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five B-OP
star I-OP
restaraunt B-AS
. O

Way O
below O
average O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
so O
overrated B-OP
and O
was O
under B-OP
cooked I-OP
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
rude B-OP
and O
not O
attentive B-OP
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

I O
love B-OP
this O
place B-AS

I O
was O
n't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
quick B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
and O
clean B-OP
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-AS
alla I-AS
marsala I-AS
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed B-OP
. O

The O
veal B-AS
and O
the O
mushrooms B-AS
were O
cooked O
perfectly B-OP
. O

The O
potato B-AS
balls I-AS
were O
not O
dry B-OP
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery B-OP
. O

The O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure O
. O

so O
slow B-OP

the O
food B-AS
was O
not O

, O
waitresses B-AS
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O

unassuming B-OP
. O

In O
the O

, O
the O
back B-AS

The O

Gross B-OP
food B-AS
– O
Wow O

I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

My O
quesadilla B-AS
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O
. O

And O
$ O
11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland B-OP
guacamole B-AS
? O

Come O
on O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
margaritas B-AS
, O
either O
. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds O
-- O
this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
your O
time O
and O
go O
somewhere O
else O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews O
-- O
I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad B-OP
this O
place B-AS
was O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word O
. O

The O

great B-OP
, O
especially B-OP
when O

The O
omlette B-AS
for I-AS

is O
great B-OP
... O

the O

just O
average O
, O
just O

Best B-OP
Indian B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
City O

Decor B-AS
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded B-OP
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
! O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best B-OP
gyros B-AS
in O
New O
York O
. O

Small O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
clean O
, O
BZ O
Grill O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints O
, O
both O
in O
Astoria O
and O
out O
. O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine B-OP
is O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in-house B-OP
( O
even O
the O
gyro B-AS
meat I-AS
and O
sausages B-AS
) O
, O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher B-OP
quality I-OP
ingredients B-AS
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected O
. O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-AS
and I-AS
Cypriot I-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
, O
but O
the O
gyro B-AS
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O

unfriendly B-OP
, O
filthy B-OP
bathroom B-AS
. O

The O
high B-OP
prices I-OP
you O
're O
going O
to O
pay O
is O
for O
the O
view B-AS
not O
for O
the O

. O

The O
bar B-AS
drinks I-AS
were O
Eh O
, O
ok B-OP
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

The O
stuff B-AS
tilapia I-AS
was O
horrid B-OP
... O
tasted O
like O

We O

Good O
Experience O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre-theater O
menu O
( O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
) O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive B-OP
- O
though O
the O
staff B-AS
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable B-OP
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
we O
received O
was O
horrible B-OP
- O
rock B-OP
hard I-OP
and O
cold B-OP
- O
and O
the O
`` O
free O
'' O
appetizer B-AS
of I-AS
olives I-AS
was O
disappointing B-OP
. O

However O
, O
our O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
. O

I O
had O
fish B-AS
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded B-OP
our O
expectations O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-AS
torte I-AS
) O
was O
good B-OP
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
unable B-OP
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect B-OP
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-AS
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful B-OP
restaurant B-AS
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-AS
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

short B-OP
and O
sweet B-OP
– O
seating B-AS
is O
great B-OP
: O
it O
's O
romantic B-OP
, O
cozy B-OP
and O
private B-OP
. O

The O
boths B-AS
are O
not O
as O
small B-OP
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
're O
perfect B-OP
for O
2 O
people O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
extremely O
fast B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
( O
thanks B-OP
to I-OP
the O
service B-AS
button I-AS
on O
your O
table O
) O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
order O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
ok B-OP
and O
fair B-OP
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy O
. O

over O
. O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B-AS
of O
the O
place O
exceeds B-OP
the O
actual O
meals B-AS
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

Impressed O
... O

Subtle B-OP
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
I O
enjoy B-OP
. O

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg B-AS
is O
my O
favorite B-OP
. O

Sometimes O
tables O
do O
n't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it O
's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-AS
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I O
've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-AS
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

Prices O
are O
fair B-OP
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-AS
and O
bev B-AS
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers B-AS
are O
patient B-OP
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

Stepping O

La I-AS
Femme I-AS
last O
night O
was O
a O
true B-OP
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O

! O

Highly O
impressed B-OP
from O
the O
decor B-AS
to O
the O
food B-AS
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O

that O
is O
to O

! O

Food B-AS
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth B-OP
waiting O
for O
. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-AS
dancing I-AS
show I-AS
that O
captivated B-OP
the O
crowd O
. O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
def O
worth B-OP
commending O
! O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-AS
! O

I O
've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
looked O
great B-OP
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
was O
very O
nice B-OP
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-AS
came O
, O
it O
was O
average B-OP
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that O
's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-AS
sauce I-AS
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
) O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food O
, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating O
, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well B-OP
prepared I-OP
food B-AS
. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-AS
with O
such O
a O
good B-OP
reputation I-OP
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack B-OP
of I-OP
intelligent B-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O

league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it O
's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

Unhygienic O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

I O
went O
there O
2times O

I O

The O
food B-AS
is O

The O
atmosphere B-AS

It O
's O
a O

I O
've O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
and O
this O
spot O
delivers B-OP
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
pretty O
nice B-OP
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking B-OP
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy B-OP
scheme B-AS
of I-AS
mirrors I-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you O
're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing B-OP
mirrors B-AS
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go-to B-OP
for I-OP
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
food I-AS
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre-fix O
was O
$ O
29/per O

but O
it O
is O
$ O
55 O
per O

not O
including O

Indo B-AS
Chinese I-AS
food I-AS
, O
pretty O
good B-OP
... O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy B-OP
place B-AS
but O
very O
good B-OP
Chinese B-AS
style I-AS
Indian I-AS
food I-AS
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
lollipop I-AS
is O
my O
favorite B-OP
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
( O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
) O
are O
quite O
oily B-OP
and O
very O
spicy B-OP
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-AS
Chicken I-AS
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-AS
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy B-OP
and O
far O
too O
oily B-OP
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
: O
) O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible B-OP
food B-AS
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
majorly O
disappointing B-OP
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-AS
dish I-AS
, O
the O
chef B-AS
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
( O
minus O
sauce O
, O
seasoning O
, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation O
) O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stunned O
, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

This O
place B-AS
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone O
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
return O
. O

! O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
NYC O
for O
bit O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene O

I O
came O
across O
Village B-AS
Underground I-AS
by O
accident O
, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
martinis B-AS
are O
amazing B-OP
and O
very O
fairly O
priced O
. O

THE O
SERVICE B-AS
IS O
AMAZING B-OP
, O
i O
've O
had O
different O
waiters B-AS
and O
they O
were O
all O
nice B-OP
, O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
DJ B-AS
is O
awesome B-OP
, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O
and O
I O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles O
. O

Which O
lets O
face O
it O
... O
.at O
times O
it O
's O

In O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great B-OP

This O
establishment B-AS
is O
the O
real B-OP
deal I-OP

There O
is O
`` O
Expensive-but-worth-it O
'' O
and O
there O
is O
`` O
Expensive-and-WTF O
'' O
? O

This O
is O
a O
twenty-something O

that O

But O
$ O

for O
a O

for I-AS

that O
did O
n't O
include O
Wine O
? O

Are O
you O
freaking O
kidding O
me O
? O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good B-OP
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good B-OP
. O

Ca O
n't O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced O
. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-AS
and O
the O
name O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
classy B-OP
and O
beautiful B-OP
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O

Which O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O

would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

Entrees O
: O
Vanison O

and O
Bison O
Steak O

Vanison B-AS
was O
good B-OP
but O
not O
amazing B-OP
. O

Bison B-AS
was O
quite O
excellent B-OP
however O
. O

Dessert B-AS
: O
pure O
disaster B-OP

Just O
not O
good O
at O
all O

Some O
Pineapple O

in O
a O

of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-AS
too O
expensive B-OP
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
`` O
I O
've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
'' O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
( O
except B-OP
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
) O
. O

The O
environment B-AS
is O
very O
upscale B-OP
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly B-OP
, O
no O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
just O
ok B-OP
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money.. O
scammers O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended B-OP
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different O
. O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience O
! O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
beautiful B-OP
! O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant B-OP
. O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
drinks B-AS
were O
were O
horrible B-OP
! O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
! O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka O
. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot B-OP
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible B-OP
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good B-OP
food B-AS
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
inedible B-OP
! O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused B-OP
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
... O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly O
! O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded O
! O

Do O
n't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6:20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
`` O
Wow O
that O
's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
are O
n't O
together O
'' O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
`` O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
'' O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple B-OP
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment B-OP
. O

Not O
much B-OP
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma O
. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
were O
delicious B-OP
but O
a O
tiny B-OP
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok B-OP
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless B-OP
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
salt B-AS
encrusted I-AS
shrimp I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
( O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma O
's O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

She O
replied O
`` O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O
'' O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-AS
style I-AS
Fried I-AS
Sea I-AS
Bass I-AS
... O
which O
was O
very O
good B-OP
. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy B-OP
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
Mahi I-AS
Mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched B-OP
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice O
! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
) O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
- O

Great B-OP
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
- O
I O
love B-OP
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
I O
've O
had O
. O

Very O
`` O
normal O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
'' O
, O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
( O
just O
chicken B-AS
tikka I-AS
masala I-AS
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$ O
25 O
) O
, O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale B-OP
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
have O
an O
upscale B-OP
feel B-AS
. O

Also O
, O
waiters B-AS
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you O
, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$ O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron O
's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

But O
if O
you O
're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS

My O

The O

We O
go O
often O

We O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life O
. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted B-OP
by O
both O
food B-AS
an O
service B-AS
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
's O
order O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre B-OP
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-AS
fair I-AS
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
's O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-AS
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting B-OP
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
( O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing O
) O
, O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted B-OP
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years O
, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school O
, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish O
, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean O
! O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-AS
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it O
's O
simply O
repulsive B-OP
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

Gorgeous B-OP
place B-AS
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous B-OP
white B-AS
organza I-AS
tent I-AS
which O
included O
a O
four B-AS
course I-AS
prix I-AS
fix I-AS
menu I-AS
which O
we O
enjoyed B-OP
a O
lot O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
spectacular B-OP
as O
the O
waiter B-AS
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing B-OP
! O

I O
completely O
recommend B-OP
Casa B-AS
La I-AS
Femme I-AS
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress B-OP
your O
date O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O
. O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi-bokum O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

The O
bibimbap B-AS
was O
average B-OP
, O
but O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
was O
n't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling B-OP
. O

Too O
bad B-OP
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone B-AS
bowl I-AS
. O

The O
nakgi-bokum B-AS
was O
horrible B-OP
. O

Easily O
the O
worst B-OP
stir-fried B-AS
squid I-AS
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

The O
side B-AS
dishes I-AS
were O
passable B-OP
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack B-OP
of I-OP
service B-AS
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
was O
n't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off O
. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either O
, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English O
. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess B-OP
of O
a O
dish B-AS
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
. O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

We O
've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

We O
've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-AS
which O
was O
amazing B-OP
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it O
's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
farro B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
the O
mashed B-AS
yukon I-AS
potatoes I-AS
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty B-OP
. O

Love B-OP
this O
place B-AS
, O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
we O
always O
go O
. O

A O
quintessential B-OP
slice B-AS
of I-AS
NYC I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

The O
crust B-AS
has O
a O
great B-OP
bite O
and O
a O
good B-OP
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-AS
is O
light B-OP
with O
a O
nice B-OP
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-AS
is O
great B-OP
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

Personally O
I O
like B-OP
the O
margherita B-AS
pizza I-AS
better B-OP
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good B-OP
. O

Possibly O
the O
Most B-OP
Romantic I-OP
Restaurant B-AS
in O
the O
City O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite B-OP
modern B-AS
Japanese I-AS
brasserie I-AS
( O
that O
don’t O
serve O
sushi O
) O
, O
and O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most B-OP
romantic I-OP
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden B-OP
spot B-AS
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-AS
wooden I-AS
doors I-AS
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate B-OP
decor B-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you’re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
you’re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you’ll O
be O
ushered B-OP
to O
private B-AS
booths I-AS
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
( O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-AS
ceilings I-AS
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
) O
. O

It’s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘excuse O
me’ O
before O
the O
waiter B-AS
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-AS
fixe I-AS
prix I-AS
menu I-AS
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful B-OP
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful B-OP
sashimi B-AS
amuse I-AS
bouche I-AS
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Black I-AS
Cod I-AS
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured B-OP
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-AS
Salmon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
better B-OP
. O

The O
entrees B-AS
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice O
. O

The O
sake B-AS
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well B-OP
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake B-AS
world O
. O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-AS
black I-AS
sesame I-AS
mousse I-AS
( O
interesting B-OP
but O
not O
extraordinary B-OP
) O
and O
matcha B-AS
powdered I-AS
green I-AS
tea I-AS
and I-AS
blueberry I-AS
cheesecake I-AS
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal B-OP
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
can’t O
say O
enough O
good B-OP
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B-AS
. O

I O
don’t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I’ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-AS
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet B-OP
, O
unhurried B-OP
and O
memorable B-OP
dinner O
. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

The O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired B-OP
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed B-OP
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored B-OP
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
. O

We O
were O
10 O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday O
, O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent O
. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing O
! O
! O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude B-OP
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible B-OP
service B-AS
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-AS
and O
their O
pita B-AS
bread I-AS
! O

Stay O
away O

Great B-OP
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it O
's O
cold O
! O

I O
love O
it O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-AS
but O
was O
n't O
too O
impressed B-OP
. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-AS
Shabu I-AS
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
much O
better B-OP
in O
NY O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I O
've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
Tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

The O
meat B-AS
is O
fresh B-OP
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
are O
great B-OP
, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
free B-OP
with O
your O
meal B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
good B-OP
too O
. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one-two O
punch O
of O
classic B-OP
Korean B-AS
food I-AS
and O
fusion B-AS
twists I-AS
like O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
tacos I-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
good B-OP
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic B-OP
pork B-AS
croquette I-AS
sandwich I-AS
, O
perfect B-OP
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-AS
. O

Restaurant O

Celebrated O
my O

birthday O
here O
. O

The O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good B-OP
. O

The O
family B-AS
seafood I-AS
entree I-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
. O

The O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good B-OP
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

This O
place B-AS
does O
n't O
make O
any O
sense O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
make O
you O
dizzy B-OP
and O
delusional B-OP
... O

This O
place B-AS
is O
not O
inviting B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird B-OP
. O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-AS
tapas I-AS
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting B-OP
, O
not O
appetizing B-OP
and O
uncooked B-OP
. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake O
. O

Good B-OP
Food B-AS

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
and O
tasty B-OP
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-AS
space I-AS
was O
too O
small B-OP
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

Over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice B-OP
romantic B-OP
place B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

Loved O
it O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved B-OP
it O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent B-OP
, O
although O
I O
would O
n't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-AS
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
was O
n't O
mean B-OP
, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm B-OP
or O
attentive B-OP
either O
. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad B-OP
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-AS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

Regardless O
, O
we O
'll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-AS
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
. O

Lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
servers B-AS
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected B-OP
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

A O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced B-OP
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
( O
which O
was O
delicious B-OP
) O
. O

Overall O
the O
food B-AS
quality O
was O
pretty O
good B-OP
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice B-OP
fit-out B-AS
, O
some O
attractive B-OP
furnishings B-AS
and O
, O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell O
, O
a O
reasonable B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
( O
I O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins O
) O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive-aggressive O
torture O
. O

On O
that O
scale O
, O
it O
's O
a O
world-beater O
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-AS
still O
open O
? O

I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers O
, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good B-OP
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
I O
was O
appalled B-OP
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked B-OP
spinach B-AS
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon B-AS
as O
fishy B-OP
, O
as O
dry B-OP
, O
and O
as O
bland B-OP
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
WALKED O
away O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach B-AS
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked B-OP
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

I O
've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O
! O
! O
! O
! O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
`` O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
'' O
No O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

No O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad B-OP
: O
the O
manager B-AS
said O
, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
it O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
comp O
it O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you O
, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore O
. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy B-OP
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
and O
appetizers B-AS
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-AS
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED B-OP

Single O
Worst B-OP
Restaurant B-AS
in O
Manhattan O

I O
'll O
being O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
positives O
: O
cool B-OP
decor B-AS
, O
good B-OP
pita B-AS
and O
hummus B-AS
, O
and O
grilled B-AS
octopus I-AS
that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty B-OP
. O

Moving O
on O
. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Casa O
La O
Femme O
is O
to O
middle O
eastern O
dining O
what O
Chuckie O
Cheeze O
is O
to O
italian O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Well O
... O
they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
ca O
n't O
hide O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I O
've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants O
. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it O
's O
manhattan O
, O
things O
are O
expensive O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

This O
place B-AS
... O
god O
where O
do O
i O
begin O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular B-OP
scene B-AS
i O
'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction B-OP
so O
you O
wo O
n't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold B-OP
eggplant B-AS
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O
! O

How O
this O
place B-AS
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

Great B-OP
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
! O

I O
've O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
( O
I O
live O
on O
UWS O
) O
. O

Though O
it O
's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I O
've O
gone O
here O
, O
Bark B-AS
always O
delivers B-OP
on O
their O
food B-AS
. O

The O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
are O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
! O

Going O
to O
Bark B-AS
is O
always O
worth B-OP
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy B-OP
! O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

But O
nonetheless O
-- O
great B-OP
spot B-AS
, O
great B-OP
food B-AS
. O

Fabulous B-OP
food B-AS
- O
if O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
do O
n't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC O
. O

It O
's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we O
've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Each O
time O
we O
've O
been O
, O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
( O
not O
the O
waiters B-AS
- O
they O
're O
fantastic B-OP
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional B-OP
fish B-AS
dishes I-AS
I O
would O
never O
return O
. O

As O
BFC B-AS
does O
n't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused B-OP
by O
the O
front B-AS
of I-AS
house I-AS
staff I-AS
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

The O
frizzy B-OP
retro O
girl B-AS
( O
with O
winged/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses O
) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
`` O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
'' O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

I O
'd O
be O
horrified B-OP
if O
my O
staff B-AS
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely B-OP
! O

There O
's O
another O
girl B-AS
who O
I O
ca O
n't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5'6 O
'' O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited B-OP
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee O
. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
I O
expect O
better B-OP
service B-AS
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who O
's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
... O

Maitre-D- O
'' O
Eat O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

The O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
were O
fine B-OP
, O
however O
the O
maitre-D B-AS
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming B-OP
and O
arrogant B-OP
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end B-OP
bottle B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
our O
son O

us O

a O

refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad B-OP
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
: O
you O
ca O
n't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre-D B-AS
's O
sense O
of O
`` O
table O
turnover O
'' O
, O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off-night O
. O

Best B-OP
meal B-AS
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

Mussles B-AS
and O
calamari B-AS
were O
superb B-OP
Saturday O
evening O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-AS
special I-AS
which O
was O
perfect B-OP
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-AS
steak I-AS
which O
was O
very O
good B-OP
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The B-AS
Four I-AS
Seasons I-AS
restaurant I-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
the O
environment B-AS
is O
even O
better B-OP
. O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

Taking O
Hot B-AS
Dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey B-OP
for O
a O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
just O
get O
your O
average B-OP
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
is O
elevated B-OP
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

Great B-OP
Atmosphere B-AS

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
fish B-AS
tacos I-AS
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

Cool B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
fire B-AS
place I-AS
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

Poor B-OP
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

Don’t O
go O
to O
this O
place B-AS
! O

Had O
an O
awful B-OP
experience O
at O
Casa B-AS
la I-AS
Femme I-AS
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
( O
another O
45mins O
) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
was O
rude B-OP
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly B-OP
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

On O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

Can’t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive B-OP
NYC O
restaurant B-AS
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful B-OP
to O
its O
clients O
. O

What O
a O
hassle O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good B-OP
, O
but O
not O
outstanding B-OP
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
or O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
... O
but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-AS
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
do O
n't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Expensive O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

Wow O
. O

The O
bread B-AS
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-AS
was O
overpriced B-OP
and O
empty B-OP
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
was O
well B-OP
cooked I-OP
, O
did O
n't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS O
. O

Her O
review O
is O
above O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
100 O
% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude B-OP
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared B-OP
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
`` O
can O
I O
help O
you O
'' O
and O
`` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
'' O

What O
? O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Shame B-OP
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible B-OP
rude B-OP
staff B-AS
and O
non-existent B-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

bad B-OP
staff B-AS

I O
generally O
like B-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good B-OP
. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good B-OP
. O

But O
the O
service B-AS
is O
HORRID B-OP
! O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed B-OP
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
. O

The O
waiter B-AS
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
) O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-AS
more O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-AS
. O
