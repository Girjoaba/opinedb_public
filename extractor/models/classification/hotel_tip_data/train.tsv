681	1		All the public areas in the hotel are lovely especially the Firepits.
30	1		I stay in probably 10 hotels a year and this one ranks as one of the best value for the money.
60	1		Yes, the location is great and full marks for hotel management making the best of what they have (modern touches, nice pillows, toiletries, etc.).
8	1		The room was lovely (A King Suite-Wong Room).
226	0		Everything about the place is a 10.
366	0		The plasma TV was nice but there was nothing on to watch, the in-house movie selection was poor but that could be down to there not being many good movies about at the moment.
140	0		The concierge told us that the shuttle service we had chosen had a reputation for not showing up and suggested an alternative service that was actually less expensive and more dependable.
927	0		Above the bed is a painting of a dark mountain (maybe?) and six hands reaching out from the darkness.
879	0		Simply put.
759	1		So, the location is one of the best things about the motel.
805	0		The worst I can say about this place?
235	0		Yes, it is a small room but if you are a light traveler it isn't a deal breaker.
33	0		Here are the highlights.
557	0		99 for 24 hours).
800	0		The rooms are tiny - the bathroom is so small that they can only place a soap and shampoo amenity in the bathroom as there is no room for any extra amenities however a shower cap would have been handy.
288	1		The desk clerk was very helpful with questions about getting around and made good suggestions for breakfast restaurants.
571	0		Also, avoid the lines of people waiting for the Powell cable car lines and instead jump on the (supposedly less picturesque, but still awesome!) almost-empty California line RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel!
332	0		This was at 5pm when the street is swarming with commuter traffic.
427	0		You were returning from the shower!
18	0		Also we had one of our rooms booked for three but only one king bed !
41	1		There is a cable car service from almost just outside the door.
733	0		Service was spotty, the lobby carpet seemed dirty.
635	0		(EG a 1.
630	0		If you pick the right streets, you miss any big hills.
965	0		Please avoid this hotel like the black plague.
88	0		Great hotel if you are doing business downtown, but if you are a traveller on vacation chose somewhere else.
689	0		If you are planning on doing Alcatraz, I would suggest the evening tour as it would be much less crowded.
806	0		Therefore it was very quiet.
713	0		Returning late in the evening chef was stiff OK to put a bar meal together.
872	0		But nice ... 2 - The homeless love the area around that hotel, no complaints.
967	0		I was happy with the hotel itself.
851	1		In fact, there were very few homeless people outside the Whitcomb, and we felt very safe.
337	0		Tips: If riding the cable cars, the line at the turn-arounds is long and cold.
652	0		I called the front desk about 10 minutes before I was to leave.
419	0		We opted to book a room without a bathroom, however the toilet and shower facilities on our floor were modern and clean.
914	0		Would stay there again.
148	0		I asked that a bottle of champagne be placed in our room in advance of our arrival.
582	1		The room was small, but very comfortable and quiet, with everything we needed.
925	0		They refused to give me a full refund, charged me for one nights stay ($125).
823	0		We were on a tour and the Rep recommended a Chineze restaurant across the road for breakfast - uugghh.
822	1		The bathrooms were well appointed and very clean.
913	0		We ate at a the Little Thai and the House of Sushi and both were delicious.
702	1		There is free internet with a printer, and every afternoon there is a wine/cheese reception in the lobby.
214	0		And here's the catch.
9	1		The area is very safe and I felt secure at all times.
297	0		I believe that the place was originally a condo (there are currently some residents who still reside there), so the walls are thick and we never heard our neighbors (although I could hear from the hallway that they had a young and loud child).
646	0		The room had two upholstered chairs that were only fair for comfort, but room lighting was excellent.
387	1		Food was good, milkshakes were great.
233	0		Both are nice but between the two we like the Harbor Court better.
319	0		The Tuscan also offered complimentary wine happy hour from 5-6pm in the warm &amp; cozy lobby where you can wind down your day and meet other hotel guests or just hang out by yourselves.
246	0		The proprietor grew up in this neighborhood and was able to guide us and answer all our questions.
263	0		a BIG BIG BIG plus was the free buisness center with (angels-singing) high speed internet! I have never seen this before for free in a major city and, although I sometimes had to wait 5-10 mins for a computer, it was well worth it.
602	0		Check-in took about 20 minutes- they seemed busy and it took a while to get to our place in line.
587	0		Highly recommend this hotel for price and location.
241	1		The wine/beer hour and cookies and milk in the evening was a very nice touch.
92	1		The bed and linens were awesome.
989	0		Out of the shadows, a man in normal clothes says &quot; your key doesn't work?
399	0		Room keys did not work in two of the doors, etc.
959	0		so if you just need a place to crash its ok.
796	0		She was having an interesting personal phone call for me to listen to though.
736	1		The location is, of course, excellent.
278	0		If you enjoy Asian fare, give the Bambuddha a try.
345	0		Oh and its very well located too .
723	0		I was extremely disappointed with my recent stay at the Hotel Union Square.
520	1		I was referred to this hotel by a friend that stayed there a few years back with it was the Brighton.
703	0		Yes, it was very noisy even though we had only an alley view.
700	1		The decor was cool and casual.
546	0		Even in smaller cities, we are used to receiving certain benefits for being repeat customers - a nicer room, access to a lounge, and a nice breakfast.
791	1		The restaurant is a bit pricy, but very good.
928	0		On the right is a large profile of a face, and in its background is a hillside with many.....little....crosses.....why, it kind of looks like a cemetery!
870	0		I mean if you're going to Frisco to visit the hotels than maybe consider the Intercontinental or some other 5 star.
655	0		Small and thin towels, thin linens, small room, $43 per day for parking (yeah, its San Francisco), outdated bathroom, etc.
54	1		Large, comfortable rooms.
548	1		All of the staff was very friendly, we had fresh towels everyday even if not requested.
983	0		Fan was broken, etc.
606	0		But it really didn't bother us too much.
364	0		That said, the rooms are in need of a refresher - the carpet in our room was stained, dirty and pulled.
70	0		I would recommend the White Swan Inn to anyone.
543	0		Were I to stay there again, I would go for the rate which includes parking ($27 a day, going rate in the city).
404	0		we stayed here for 3 nights and it was just fantastic peaceful and the staff we're so helpful would recommend this place anytime
197	1		The location is pretty ideal, about 5 mins walk from Market.
616	1		The registration staff was very accomodating and helpful.
145	1		The bed is super comfy, used the iPod dock/alarm clock - which was a nice touch.
228	0		Lunch is a better bet as breakfast is very expensive, and the dinner menu seems limited.
701	1		Very convenient location clean rooms, the beds were comfortable and overall we had a very pleasant stay.
170	0		The receptionist was very polite and we noted her attention to our fatigued condition as she alerted housekeeping of their timing problem.
477	1		Room: Clean, comfy bed, nice bathroom, big wardrobe &amp; never heard any noise from other guests.
926	0		I would stay here again if I needed a budget destination.
865	0		It seemed dirtier than most larger cities and there was an abundance of homeless in the area of the hotel.
61	0		We LOVED this hotel.
786	0		We have stayed on different floors during our three stays.
816	0		Irresponsible, inattentive and unreliable.
728	0		Some might find the tv a joke as it's only a 19&quot; model, but then again, I wasn't shelling out big bucks for watching tv.
420	0		Stingy amenities - free coffee and muffins in the morning, all very well, it's not a bed-and-breakfast, after all; but oh, the cheeseparing of making the guests sign on every day, at $9.
888	0		we had no tv and there was no wifi available, but there was a computer with internet connection available for free next to the reception.
499	1		The three-story Nob Hill Motel is perfect if you drive into San Francisco and want a nice motor court style place.
881	1		Also, the hotel has a computer in the lobby for you to check into your flight, and check on your flight status, which is very helpful.
985	0		972 Sutter is &quot; walkable&quot; to Union Square or Chinatown (10+ blockes straight on Sutter), but eventually you would opt to take the frequent buses 2, 3, or 4, which runs on Sutter coming, and one street down on Post going.
144	0		We stayed in one of the 180 degree Panoramic suites on the last night of our Honeymoon and it was the perfect finish.
346	0		I have no idea why there are so many good reviews for this hotel.
402	0		The first night we arrived pretty late so I think we didn't get the upgrade, we were on the 3rd floor in a smaller room.
637	0		I would definitely stay here again!
589	0		From the moment we first arrived it was pretty much one bad experience after another..Firstly, we arrive at 3pm to be told our room is not ready and to come back in an hour..No drama..Off we go to get something to eat and one hour later arrive back to be checked in by some ditsy airhead who I heard mutter 'I don't have any double beds' (we were 2 females travelling and had booked a room with 2 doubles) but then continued to tap away on her keyboard for at least 5mins before handing us our room keys..
11	1		Dinner the second night was in their Chop House restaurant , which is a must, especially for wine lovers as they have been voted as having one of the top 10 wine lists in the world.
773	1		5 mile walk to the famous Fisherman's Wharf and Peir 39, where all the touristy restaraunts and great food (and Sea Lions) await.
691	0		The check-in was fast.
115	0		Staff were very friendly - I never waited for service - early check-in/late check-out &amp; they stored our bags while we were out of the room but not yet ready for our flight.
599	0		Well worth it.
771	0		If I left it at that I would rate my stay a 3 or 4 but upon check out the front desk hit me with an erroneous charge on my bank card and held funds that I needed on my next leg of my trip.
19	0		We checked in early, no problem, and when we were leaving they held our luggage all day because our flight wasn't until 10: 00 that night.
883	1		This is also one of the few hotels in downtown SF with free parking, but it is rather limited, so don't count on a space being available if you arrive late in the evening.
567	0		We were given a room on the 7th floor, it faced away from the street which i assume is a distinct advantadge as it can get quite noisy with trams etc.
929	0		Also, there is no A/C, but when you crack the window open, there are no screens, so you worry about opening the window to an alley full of trash bins (will bugs crawl in?).
300	0		We stayed for 2 weeks and would recommend it to all looking for a budget hotel in a great location!
141	0		We found a lower rate on hotels and they honored the agreement ($114/night!!), no problem.
608	1		The bedroom had two very comfortable queen beds and the living room had a comfy murphy bed.
109	0		This was not a difficult request due to the size of this property and number of rooms that fit this description- if my first choice was not available, I was hoping for an exterior view and was not restricted by budget.
553	0		These are the TINIEST rooms I have ever seen!
562	1		Front desk staff were friendly and helpful.
748	0		I bought my bus pass at the Tourist Center and Powell and Market; $24 for 7 days - a bargain.
372	0		Only niggles: why can't you open the windows in large American hotels?
664	0		We were on a shopping spree and stayed 3 nights at the Vintage.
785	0		Breakfast (if you like cooking your own waffles and hard boiled eggs!) was included but I just took advantage of the coffee.
360	1		Large flat panel TV, and a choice of relaxing music CDs for the sound system.
778	0		Most areas were between $5-10 dollars to get to in a cab and the Embarcadero centre is right across the street for those of you looking to shop.
863	1		There was nothing to complain about, check in and check out were fast.
373	0		The only problem we ever encountered was the long queue for catching cabs in front of the hotel.
783	0		Service is ok.
798	0		The thing that really lets this hotel down is the staff.
209	0		Will definitely stay there when in SF again.
578	1		The room was a really nice size, the bed was really comfy and the rainhead shower was great and we had a fridge!
449	0		The hotel publicity states that safety deposit boxes are available at reception, but they are actually in the room.
159	0		We had booked 2 interior rooms, but on arrival agreed to share a room on the first night as the hotel had overbooked.
21	1		The price was reasonable for San Francisco.
367	0		Most of the guests seemed to be tourists from the Asia region and business people.
675	0		Whilst the sun is warm as soon as you go into the shade (or on a bus or ferry) the wind can be freezing cold so make sure you take a warm fleece jacket / cardigan to use when needed.
763	0		It was such a nice place.
59	1		Huge walk in closet to store our belongings.
400	0		5 star hotel.
103	1		The location of this hotel was perfect.
116	0		If location is the most important thing to you, this is the place to stay, but that's the only reason.
679	1		The hotel itself is clean and comfortable.
958	0		We actually explored the neighborhood a iittle more this visit, and found it to be full of restaurants and markets and movie houses.
788	0		Sorry, you'll have to come down to get your extra pillow.
328	1		This hotel is near Hotel Monaco and the Clift Hotel and Union Square.
878	1		Staff fairly friendly.
342	0		What a day!
37	1		The location is perfect - close to shopping and wonderful restaurants.
641	0		I had to do laundry at the hotel as we had been on the road for several days.
640	0		I got both.
576	1		Gorgeous facility with excellent conference center.
7	0		The Hotel itself is situated in Pacific Heights which in my opinion is nicest area of San Fransico but it is a $5-$10 taxi ride from Fishermans Wharf etc - however the hotel is in walking distance of some awesome resteraunts &amp; the area is very safe and and is really a tourist attraction itself.
977	1		Its in a good location and for the price it is, you really cannot complain.
749	0		It was great having a Hertz outlet right in the hotel - we had rented a car for our second week and the convenience of having Hertz right there made the car rental very stress-free.
193	0		My previous stay there was for 4 nights in 2003.
920	0		This hotel does not deserve its #6 rating as one of the best hotels in San Francisco.
26	0		Location was alright, not that close to Union Sq though.
497	0		The FREE parking put my mind at ease when-- I kid you not-- I witnessed one meter maid hand out four tickets in the span of ten minutes.
1	0		I work in the travel industry and have seen some real nice properties (paradors in Spain, etc.).
529	0		All in all a hotel to be recommended and we would stay there again.
28	0		Also, Post St. is one of the major routes into Union Square, and there is lots of traffic.
31	0		An oasis just steps from Union Square and the city at your doorstep.
774	0		It did not feel very private.
178	1		If you're coming to San Francisco to go and sightsee and not spend much time in the room this place is perfect with its great location and clean facilities.
375	1		Free internet (cable is in a plastic bag hanging in the closet).
970	0		The hotel's bath towels are rough and is about the size of a small wash cloth or half the width of a regular towel.
536	0		The rooms are that way aswell.
426	0		Given that inconvenience I still had a blast in this hotel.
433	1		Convenient location to numerous public transit centers.
818	1		There were plenty of shops at close hand, the tram line starts very close by too, so it makes a good starting point to your day and convenient to come back to.
459	0		However, after booking on indirectly through expedia, we were put in a triangle room (king bed) which was modern and clean, but small and awkward.
588	0		Breakfast was fine as well all we needed to start the day once again if you want a cooked breakfast then pay more money and stay somewhere else.
522	0		Newspaper comes with breakfast!
880	0		In all fairness, we did get what we paid for, and I can't really compare to other hotels in the area, but I feel it was a bit overpriced for what it is.
992	0		However, my mom's room was TOTALLY FILTHY and smelled like mold (there actually was green mold in bathroom ceiling, but maintenance came in to clean with bleach).
900	1		The hotel has a good restaurant, Mel's Diner (from LA) which is open nearly all night.
990	0		Even after telling the front desk about the problem, we came back that night to a still-broken toilet.
314	0		Perhaps I missed something, but the only things Fisherman's Wharf was good for was the ferry to Alcatraz and hiring a bike to ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito (both 'must-dos' whilst in San Fran).Drinks from 5-6pm were a great chance to meet other guests and as an aperitif before dinner (incidentally, we dined one night at the restaurant next to the Tuscan Inn; it was excellent, and you get 10% off for staying at the hotel).
930	0		If you don't like the sounds of the city , then go to the forest.
325	0		Reviews indicating it is not in a safe area are inaccurate.
720	0		I stayed at the Union Square Hotel for 2 nights in October 2006.
341	0		We didn't need any information from the front desk, so I can't comment on their service.
801	1		The lobby is pretty, and the front desk staff that checked us in was friendly and efficient.
276	0		They told us were to go and where not to go.
152	0		WE LOVED IT!!EAT AT PAT'S CAFE WE ATE THERE
260	1		It was beautiful and not far from many attractions.
102	1		The rooftop garden was a nice place to sit and have a glass of wine with our friends before heading out for dinner.
270	0		The downside: the conceirge was less than helpful when we tried ot arrange a ball game -she tried to get us tickets via an agent and gave us misleading information about the game being booked out and only realy expensive tickets available through an agent.
627	0		The Prescott Hotel was decent.
213	1		The bed was super comfy, nice amenities, great location, and the list goes on.
909	1		Also, the hotel was close to all major attractions.
471	0		The staff were mostly snobbish and rude, like working for the Argent gave them some kind of status that was above yours.
15	0		We stayed at the Omni over Labor Day weekend for 3 nights...I had stayed at this hotel before the year before in December, and fell in love with it...
361	0		It has taken over a month now to get a phone call back to settle these disputes.
73	0		What can I say, the noise, the run down tacky souvenir stores, the odour, pokey rooms, loud decor did not appeal to me.
414	1		The manager and team are all really nice and the hotel is quiet.
124	1		Our room overlooked Huntington Park and Grace Cathedral.
767	0		Then there's the neighborhood...I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, so I know what inner city life can be like.
540	0		I had the same experience.
780	1		Very clean and stylish. Comfy bed.
710	0		We had the junior suite which is the way to go so that you can have walking room and a place to sit.
461	0		The view was a city view, but the view would have been nicer if the outside of the window was cleaned.
111	0		Recommend this beautiful hotel.
65	1		The hotel is very central, just off Union Square and a few doors down from the Westin St. Francis.
224	0		This was irritating, to say the least.
232	1		The hotel was clean and comfortable, I appreciated the Aveda products, and we enjoyed the wine at happy hour.
203	1		The price is right (with free parking), it's in a lovely neighborhood away from the crowds, and has terrific modern decor (quite refreshing from traditional hotel furniture).
16	0		After a very poor experience at another SanFran Hotel it was a pleasure to check into the Omni.
91	0		Wow!!
330	0		The room I stayed in was a Junior Suite which was big enough for me.
168	0		We will return!
617	1		It is within walking distance to Union Square (shopping) 15mins and about 20mins to Fishermans wharf and ferries to Alcatraz.
622	0		Despite all that we had a great time.
937	0		This was a real shame as the hotel itself was not too bad, it appeared clean although the staff were not very friendly and the rooms were quite dark.
456	0		Upon walking in there is a small room without furniture and a very large bay window.
895	0		Or you can walk down Bush and once you get down far enough, you can come back toward Geary and end up at Union Square (if you're concerned about avoiding Tenderloin, this is your best route).Take a cable car on California Street to downtown (after you get a Starbucks around Van Ness and California) - trust me on this one...the cable car will not have any tourists - only local San Fran's and you.
968	0		We asked on possibility of connection to Internet and were told that there are two positions in the lobby by payment.
354	0		Had booked hotel as had pool and gym but this was at sister hotel only so no access there.
932	0		We have visited in the past six months and so I feel up to date on its amenities and service and in that way qualifed to speak about this placeI think it is important to say that although we keep coming back to this hotel and enjoy it and certainly reccomend it to others, it does have a few drawbacks and would not be to everyone's tasteBecause I have read extreme reviews of Seal Rock on this site ranging from highly critically to very complimentary, I wanted to try to provide a little balance...this might help you see if it is for youWHAT WE LIKE ABOUT SEAL ROCK INNits charm , its history and uniquenss...it is really is from another era..
852	0		The hotel was, however, very understanding and sympathetic to the situation, they comped me 1 night parking, which was unncecessary, but appreciated.
131	1		The hotel is part of the Joy of Life club, which I strongly suggest people join.
807	0		There was mold and mildew on the ceiling and the surrounding walls.
993	0		Be careful managing your cases as you will be on a very steep hill side to reach your room !
107	1		Lastly, the spa, fitness facilities and pool are also perfect.
217	0		Not a free night's stay.
432	1		Lovely boutique hotel with great rooms, beds and decor - super spacious (we got a corner room).
815	0		This was our first time in SF and everyone was amazingly courteous and forthcoming.
177	0		We arrived on Thursday night at 9pm.
368	0		I will stay here again.
48	0		We felt that the price we paid ( we booked directly with the hotel) represented good value especially since a simple continental breakfast was included.
216	1		The staff is extremely pleasant and accommodating, particularly Johames, who's awesome.
220	0		I did not realize how significant this was until I started mentally comparing it to the long treks through gargantuan lobbbies and hallways that are all so common these days at large downtown hotels.
735	0		I got room service twice and thought the food was just OK, one night the food was about an hour late.
198	1		The room was spacious, clean and modern, equipped with flat-screen TV and i-pod dock.
385	0		The room and beds were a little smaller than we enjoyed elsewhere on the trip but everything was clean and tidy and the parking was a real bonus.
478	0		It was first class, family friendly and its proximity to everywhere we wanted to go made SF and the whole weekend fun.
510	1		The sheets were so soft and the pillows were great also.
550	1		It is a typical Hilton quality hotel with everything you would expect from a Hilton.
386	0		The one bedroom suite was bigger than my first apartment, was beautifully furnished with a fully equipped kitchen and spacious bathroom, and was kept spotlessly clean throughout our stay.
324	0		I had all the booking details with me as well as the room number but to no avail until I literally begged.
34	1		We interacted with 6 different staff - all very warm, engaging, and very helpful with bus routes, local attractions, etc.
68	0		The first time I stayed at the White Swan, I had called to book the Petit Auberge.
258	0		The beds are all new - they were still in the process of replacing some on the day that I arrived.
855	0		Everything was ready when we checked in - hotel rooms assigned and names on the key.
440	0		As this was our first vacation to SanFran and Napa Valley, we felt best being stationed in the Union Square area.
136	1		Room was clean and well equipped.
727	0		Not necessarily my taste, although an appetizer and martini is a great start to any night...
56	0		Valet came right out and greated us.
248	0		My wife and I recently were looking for a nice yet economic place to stay in the San Francisco area.
524	0		Thanks Handlery for a great visit!
591	0		When we checked in, our room was not ready which was not a surprise as it was noon, so we checked our luggage and went out for lunch/sightseeing.
853	0		Rooms and bathrooms need updateing badly!!
857	0		Just get yourself a Muni pass (3 day pass only $18. 00) and you have transportation to all over the city just 20 feet to the right of the Hotel entrance (Underground Muni &amp; Bart station).
256	0		Unfortunately I can't comment on the cost of the hotel as it was paid for by work.
189	0		What to say about Market St and its environs?
146	0		The next morning, when we asked for an extra half hour after check-out, we were given a firm &quot; no.&quot; I wouldn't stay here again, and for the price, one might expect a nicer attitude.
711	0		I would definitely recommend this hotel!
750	0		We arrived and checked in to a room which had been used by a previous guest.
234	0		Lot's of crafty items for sale.
605	0		If you return during the afternoon enjoy a bit of red and white wine, cheese and crackers.
167	0		I loved the service the moment my husband and I arrived with our two children.
933	0		My husband &amp; I stayed for 6 nights and found the charm of the motel to be perfect for our stay in SanFran.
122	0		So they put me in a double room, which was no big deal at all, I just thought that it was inappropriate to imply that because I got a good rate and prepaid through hotwire that I would be treated differently.
195	1		We only stayed two nights, but their hospitality made us feel like we were long-time friends and frequent guests.
624	0		The air is perfumed with ginger, garlic, and exotic herbs all day long.
418	1		The room was compact but adequate, and there was a Jazz CD gift in the room produced by the owner.
859	0		Our room faced Market St. and we did hear sirens and the streetcars rumble by, but did not have any problems falling asleep.
160	0		On the plus side, water efficiency isn't that established with the showers so you can an amazing spray!!
609	0		I found this hotel from reading Frommer's book.
945	0		I booked the room for a king bed, smoking, 2 adults.
842	1		Large room and we loved the walk in closet!

261	1		Generally, everything looked nice and most of the people who worked there were very very nice.
10	1		There are some nice restaurants a few blocks walk away and its a short taxi ride or bus ride into downtown or fishermans wharf.
401	0		We ate most Breakfasts at the bakery down the street .
825	0		Stay away from the mini-suite on the second floor at the corner of Mason &amp; Bay; it's one of the noisiest hotel rooms I've ever had the pleasure of being moved from.
27	0		The wine and cheese was a great way to meet some of the other guests and get ideas about places to check out in SanFran.
530	0		Not only did he upgrade us to a deluxe King room, but he provided us with snacks and a bottle of wine too.

549	0		Overall what I would call a bog-standard business-type hotel I definitely would not want to take my family there.
424	0		The only drawbacks - which are no secret - are that the rooms are small (although very well arranged) and the bathrooms are shared (or at least mine was).

125	0		The shower is a nice size, but water gets everywhere (a serious design flaw), and there is absolutely no vanity.
824	0		My advice to travellers is to stand your ground at the reception and demand what you have booked.
979	1		This is a budget hotel and the room and bathrooms were clean and sufficient.
976	1		It is steps away from several nice shopping and eating neighborhoods,( chestnut st. and union st.)and the beautiful marina and presidio.
323	1		Service was friendly and efficient.
512	0		That was a plus since we had 4 hours to spare until our flight!
583	1		The room size was perfectly fine for me, but I think a couple would feel quite cramped in a cozy double room.
397	0		The room was updated recently; the styling is decent but the bed was not the most comfortable.
95	0		Towels were nice cotton towels, but I thought should have been bamboo if &quot; green&quot; was the intent.
295	0		All in all, this is a clean and cute motel in great location, but do not expect a fanciful place with wonderful amenities.
632	1		I couldn't believe the fantastic service, from providing our dogs with individual fluffy dog beds to the doorman devising a wine tasting route in Anderson Valley for us.
639	0		The free breakfast was better than many breakfast buffets that i have paid for.
906	1		The staff are helpful and friendly and the location is very convenient to just about anything.

969	1		Hotel Renoir, built in 1909 (almost 100 yrs old), is a unique-looking, triangular hotel that has 7 floors and straddles Market and McAllister street.
466	0		We had the buffet breakfast once, and thought it overpriced, but when we got double billed and called the front desk about it, they apologized and removed the charge completely, so for a free meal, it was excellent:)The location is great.
647	0		The cleaning staff did a good job keeping my room clean and stocked and the daily newspaper was laying in front of my door each morning by 7am.
106	1		Not only ice cream but cookies, chocolate, whipped cream and a rose on the side.
139	0		Athough it's been redone, the dark lobby/bar area look like it was once a hip and cool hangout that's a little past its prime.
180	0		Next time I will save $40 a night and turn my lights off, use my own shampoo and stay in the same room for less while doing my part to chip in for the environment.
912	0		So, I called the general manager, and he was curt and rude with me on the phone.
496	1		Nob Hill Motor Inn is in a great location.
699	0		The hotel's best offer was to shack us all up in a single room with double beds in a hotel where the rates were $150 more per night.

128	0		We caught a ride down to a restaurant and were quite impressed with our driver.

304	1		The concierges was great with helping to find our way around.

949	1		The Cosmo is a good hotel at a fair price.
948	1		This was also quite nice for the price we were paying.
253	0		What made the pass even handier was the MUNI kiosk that sells the 3-day Muni passes was just outside the Powell St. BART station, so we purchased our passes even before we initially walked to the Serrano.

668	0		I got an excellent deal at the Hotel Fusion and spent a week there.
947	0		We paid it in order to keep peace, but told him we would never stay at any of his places again (he also owns the Roadway inn.)Place was Ok, but they use too much Pinesol, which might be covering an insect poison substance.
443	0		Best Location!!
996	0		This hotel may be a good deal, but the place is dirty and the staff is rude.
726	0		But the furnishings were kind of like an IKEA blow out sale.
572	0		Also a friend came by to take me to dinner and left his car for Valet parking while we walked to a nearby restaurant, two hour later he picked up his car for a $57 fee!

626	0		I got into town early and I was able to check in early.
348	0		The breakfast is more than adequate, with a good selection,(but the toasters could do with replacing).Fishermans Wharf is very good, and we would HIGHLY recommend trying the clam chouder which is served up in a bread bowl, its just gorgeous.
302	0		Friendly staff.
205	0		Even ear plugs and a pillow over the head could not muffle the noise which was really quite unbelievable for what I presume was a number of bars in the same area.
797	0		The room service was also over-priced and the restaurant (which I had heard good things about) was really terrible.
338	0		They said the Holiday Inn Express was as nice or probably even nicer than the Hilton.
425	0		In my research, I found The Mosser was one of the most reasonably priced hotel in the area, but it's still very expensive.
498	0		This property is awesome because of you.
185	1		The hotel has an arrangement with a Cafe a few doors down for continental breakfast service.
211	0		We needed to be nearer the center.
36	0		The view is non-existent - looks out on another building nearby, but here's the nice part: sheers cover the window so you don't see the building and light comes in, and because it does not face the street, the room is extremely quiet and great for a good night's sleep.
766	0		We travel extensively with our two young girls (age 4 and 6) and we like for them to see the 'real' side of places, not just the same old Holiday Inn... We found this hotel charming, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and overall we loved it.
273	0		The hotel was very nice with exzcellent service .

734	0		The bed was comfortable and clean but the room itself was dusty and in need of renovation.
491	0		Fisherman's Wharf was too far.
98	1		The only negative was that I could hear the garbage truck during the night, but I wouldn't have traded me view even with the noise.
238	0		They also delivered a NY Times to my doorstep.
781	0		All in all, for the $75 a night we paid through Priceline, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
82	0		It looked silly.
621	1		The hotel is in Chinatown more so than the financial district and just a couple of blocks away from little Italy which is great!
603	0		Some might have been disappointed with the construction going on - but for us it was no issue - the location is by far the most important.
240	1		This hotel is located right on the waterfront, in the Embarcadero area - a beautiful area.
266	1		They were always willing to make suggestions for restaurants, events, etc. and made sure we never got lost.
831	0		Housekeeping staff were friendly Two times I asked for a wake-up call: the first I received, the second I did not.
537	0		We had drinkswith friends in the Grill Restaurant located just off the lobby and had a great time.
151	0		Well, the two people we encountered were far from friendly, and when Noah checked us out he wasn't anything special.
984	0		I felt as if my son smoked his first pack of cigarettes.

885	1		This room is very handy if you need to be near the airport.
204	1		The little kitchenette helped us save money (for other things while shopping!).
574	0		The bathtub itself (and the fixtures, lighting etc) is reminiscent of your average roadside Holiday Inn from the late 70s.
892	0		I stayed at the Adante this past weekend, and although I felt a little uneasy walking into our rooms due to the lack of windows and ridiculous decor, I immediately settled in and was suprisingly comfortable in my surroundings.

862	0		It is a convenient location.

837	1		Room was nice decorated, with 2 queens.
268	0		No problem.
607	0		Super Shuttle from airport was $20 ($16 + tip).Booked through travel agent but had found good internet special so booked that ($119/night).
363	0		Would definitely stay at this hotel again.
551	0		&quot; Impossible, fully booked, we'll try tomorrow&quot; (?
799	0		I try not to be too picky but the rugs in the lobby and hallways were filthy.
305	1		This hotel is in a good location on Fisherman's Wharf.
768	1		They have complimentary wine on Friday and Saturday evenings, and complimentary coffee and tea each morning.
206	0		The whirlpool, steam room and sauna are within the spa--all are on the small side.
915	1		Very helpful people in getting directions to everywhere we wanted to go.
287	1		Ask for a quiet room and you'll get a good nights sleep but be aware that Lombard Street is busy 24/7.
577	1		Harbor Village (Chinese dim sum restaurant) is next door in the Embarcadero Center.
516	0		My husband and I spent 3 nights at The Cartwright Hotel.
490	0		The hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms were roomy for 2 adults and 2 children with 5 pieces of luggage.
523	1		A small hotel with its own parking place.
908	1		Took the shuttle back to the airport as it was reasonable.
692	0		Paying a little extra for the Club Room was a real boon especially for hungry teenage children as breakfast and hors d'oerves in the evening were included in the room price.
460	1		Located right on Market, it's very conveniently located to just about anywhere you want to go in SF downtown.
505	1		The room was average size and offered a Japanese soaking tub, which was a much appreciated feature.
682	1		It was fabulous, you must book a table there the views are spectacular.
183	0		The timing was too close to send me an email confirmation, but the reservation agent made sure I had the name of the desk manager who assured me that my reservation was all in order.
896	0		After a business trip my husband joined me in San Francisco.
890	0		If you don't need turn down service, chocolates on your pillow, an excercise room, pool, or a restaurant on site, The Stanyan Park Hotel will work for you.
344	0		The room was ready upon arrival and was very clean.
87	0		The baths, while spotless, apparently were not renovated with the rest of the rooms ... they have that &quot; glamorous&quot; 1980s look -- chunky beige and pink marble with gold fixtures.
611	0		I wish they had juice or milk.
845	1		Front desk staff was very fast and pleasant.
173	0		He likes things cold, much colder than most people.
680	0		Only thing is the heater is a bit noisy. and they should place a minibar in the room.
560	1		Very friendly and helpful staff.
481	1		Any staff member we asked for directions was ready with a highlighter to outline for us on the maps that the hotel has available.

613	0		Our room faced Post St. and was VERY noisy.
340	0		I know it was off season, but that was part of the reason for visiting San Francisco.

243	0		Continental breakfast consists of: Coffee, tea, juice, hot chocolate; fresh fruit rotation: oranges, apples, bananas, nectarines; pastries, muffins, yogurt, breakfast bars.
573	0		Over 3 days we found that this is a perfect base for local touring.
955	0		But the price was so much cheaper than anything else in the area, that we decided to risk it.
282	1		When looking for a hotel in a city full of experiences like San Francisco, you want something that is going to be as memorable and special as the rest of your experience - the Phoenix Hotel is this.
642	0		The hotel advertised their new luxurious beds but they were a disappointment--much too soft for a good night's sleep.
581	1		Charming, historic little hotel with friendly staff.
252	1		The Serrano is perfectly situated for a stay in San Francisco.
673	0		One morning we walked 2 blocks to Market street and could take any of a number of buses and streetcars to anywhere.
149	0		They do have wi-fi service, however, I found it to be a bit weak with my iTouch at times.

78	1		Everyone from the bell person to the desk were great.
916	0		We arrived about 11 in the morning.
114	0		When we walked up the ramp from the BART to the the end of Powell Street we were blown away as it was our first time in San Francisco and with the cable car in front of us it was like being in a postcard.
660	1		The elevator was friendly too.
556	1		There is a Starbucks in the huge reception area and this can be useful for a quick snack to go.

850	1		The room had cool patterned victorian wallpaper.
322	1		We could see the Transamerica pyramid.
202	1		The hotel is in Presidio Heights so it isn't right in the middle of town, but it is definitely a comfortable place to stay.
923	0		Next, no elevator.
215	0		We ate dinner Friday night at Plouf, a French restaurant about 10-15 minute walk away and had awesome mussels, mine was in coconut broth, with a little spice.
832	1		Great Location right next to the BART station means you don't need a car or have to get a Taxi from the Airport, plus there's the Muni Historic F line and the Cable car turnaround right outside the door.
492	0		This is a four or five star hotel.
474	1		The hotel was easy to get to via BART and then a short cheap taxi ride, and was in a good location atop Nob Hill with easy access back down to Union Sq. and other locations via the cable cars which pass the hotel.
636	1		Beds are incredibly cozy, (kids said even the pull out bed was comfortable), complimentary continental breakfast for Club Level members was nice on the 4th floor, and the staff is sooooooo nice and knowledgable.

294	0		This hotel was a very solid 4.
707	0		We were on the fifth floor and the only street noise was the occasional ambulance.
493	1		All the staff were very friendly and helpful and room was spacious and clean.
51	1		Had a great time at the hotel.
921	1		. You can pick up the 6/7/71 bus just a block from the hotel which goes right through the centre (West to East) and only takes 5 minutes, plus another bus line goes past the hotel going North/South so all directions are covered.
790	0		With delays at the airport, I was not in San Francisco until 2am in the morning and had to wake up at 6am for an early meeting.
854	0		Would I stay in this hotel again?
575	0		A charge to open the minibar even if nothing used.
887	0		We then went out for the evening and when we returned we found that the taps would not work so I phoned the front desk and was informed that we had to turn on the valves under the sink - as these could not be turned they sent a member of staff who also could not turn these valves on.
475	0		I chose the view and the windows were so well insulated that the noise was no problem (and I am a very light sleeper).

470	0		Without even asking we were upgraded to the 36th floor.
828	0		Bring your own hairdryer...you have to get one from the front desk and they are not very good.
349	0		The hotel room was tiny but very clean.
654	1		Most of the staff was very friendly.
503	0		Recently spent two nights at this wonderful, quiet hotel.
762	1		All in all it was a perfect city hotel. You can get to the sightseeing points quickly and easily and there are enough amenities near the hotel (a 24 hr wallgreens for example) as well.
199	0		This is the place to stay on business, not on a romantic trip (because there are better locations for that).
620	0		Yes, I could hear people in the next room.
388	1		The room was extremely spacious and very clean - as was the bathroom.
231	0		Wished that there might've been a converience store (7-11 or the like) nearer to the hotel, but not a major deal.
4	0		I had mentioned that this was a sentimental journey, and we were upgraded to a charming one-bedroom suite.
242	0		The only big negativ point for us was the heat in the room.
811	0		One elevator for a hundred or so rooms means be prepared to wait a long time or take the stairs.
142	0		Location also perfect for our activities.
847	0		Third year in a row.
97	1		You can even take Bart from the airport and ride to the Montgommery Station, walk 4 blocks and you're there.
534	0		Ghiradelli Square and Hyde St Pier is a good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, especially if you are interested in historic ships and maritime matters.
138	0		I was thrilled that I did not have to use my car to get around.
972	0		Well day on after a 17 hour flight i look at the depressing reception hoping things are better upstairs well i was wrong.
911	0		If you want a great location and price and aren't offended by dated decor, this is the place for you! :)
802	1		Wi-fi was available and worked well, although it cost $10/day.
308	1		It also had a pleasant courtyard view.
376	1		The pool was nice and kept clean and the exercise room was well equipped with great workout machines (each of the treadmills, stairsteppers and bicycles had there own TVs built into them).
841	0		However, the hotel itself is in need of upgrading.
667	1		For price and location this hotel is very hard to beat.
316	0		If anyone has any questions please send me an e-mail, I'll try to help.
744	0		Okay....you live in the area and want to do something different
415	1		Annabel's Bistro is part of the hotel, and both lunch and dinner were very good and reasonably priced.
161	0		Our room was great - we were upgraded.
428	0		We asked to change our room, because of the small bed, but the receptionist said that all double beds in the hotel are at the same size and that the hotel stands in the USA standards of beds (even printed some paper with the bed sizes).
866	0		The diner averaged about $7-9 per plate for breakfast and lunch.
192	0		However, if you know San Francisco, the hotel's location on Market Street means that you will encounter the street people that are an integral part of the fabric of this city.
455	0		Initially we didn't like the location near the elevators and ice machine, but the soundproofing is so good we didn't notice noise at all.
787	1		The hotel is also on the corner of Lombard street, where the ' most crooked street in the world' is just over the ( very steep ) hill.
757	1		They will be happy to provide you with maps and directions and their personal recommendations of places to eat and shop in the neighborhood.
511	1		The bed was very nice.
715	1		On the positive side, the location is excellent and the hotel is well maintained and very clean.
347	1		Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, including those at Fisherman's Whart.
343	0		I'm not sure I will book a hotel through Hotwire again.
40	0		My daughter is working in San Francisco and we will definitely be happy to stay here on a future visit.
558	1		Breakfast was a nice addition, although expectations should be realistic for the price paid, it is a basic continental provision with muffins, toast, coffee and orange juice but it serves it's purpose well.
946	0		If you are not used to big cities, you may find the area a bit intimidating at night but as a fit youngish male it doesn't bother me.
210	1		The full kitchen and lay out of the apartment enhanced our entire San Francisco experience.
924	0		Did come with a small fridge which was a plus for me so I can store my Diabetic medicine.
269	1		Walking distance to Fisherman's wharf and cable cars.
566	0		Me and my hubby were on our honeymoon to the US and SF was our first stop.
752	0		We visited family and saw the sights while we were there.
313	0		They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all.
45	0		This hotel deserves the reviews it gets.
484	0		I would NEVER stay in a Marriott again - all b/c of this place.
447	0		There are complimentary ear plugs which I had to use (light sleeper) but they did the trick.
123	0		The man who stands outside is very rude we weren't sure what his title was but he was very condescending to my husband.
838	0		Monday morning we caught the BART at Powell to the airport, $5.
760	0		The entry into the garages are pretty narrow, but we have a 2001 BMW 740iL and we were able to squeeze it in pretty nicely.- No A/C - but, our stay couldn't have had better weather.
172	1		It's a good price; it's well cared-for; the staff members are helpful; the restaurant is good; it's a reasonable walk to all sorts of great places (many straight uphill, of course).
483	0		We were really looking forward to our San Francisco vacation and it really was a perfect weekend - except for the hotel.
187	1		If you need to get to Moscone center it's about a 10 minute walk through downtown.
101	0		But the main reason I only gave the hotel 4/5 is because of the gym.
669	1		The cleaning lady was very nice and she does a wonderful job.
444	0		One final note...We were somewhat uncomfortable with the fact that anyone could enter the hotel and directly access the elevators, and thus room floors, without a card key.
281	1		The ambience and decor carry much more character than most other hotels
756	0		I stayed in Marriott on Fourth Street during the weekend of the NIKE Womens Marathon.
80	1		For breakfast, try Dottie's True Blue Cafe one block from hotel.
521	0		We didn't think much of the place we were recommended to for breakfast.
166	1		I have to say that this minute you walk into this hotel you are amazed and feel luxurious.

398	0		Stayed for business and within walking distance of most things downtown.
966	0		Well, I didn't actually get to stay at the hotel.
150	0		Only a 3 block walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiardelli Square, 1 block from the world famous lombard street you are in the middle of everything, yet the hotel was very quiet even though there was no vacancy and the neighborhood was very safe even at night.
843	0		Not too bad in my opinion, well situated close to Pier 39.
329	0		Eventually we called reception to ask for some and within minutes a staff member brought up one roll bearing the name of a hotel three buildings up Geary Street!!!
219	1		The bed was comfortable, linens were soft, and towels were big and fluffy.
936	0		Iron+board in poor shape.
812	0		HOTEL was awsome!
196	0		We were sent to a &quot; sister&quot; property around the corner and were bitterly disappointed by the lack of courtesy and efficiency of the Petite Auberge staff.

14	0		My husband and I spent our 12th anniversary here, and we both became violently ill the morning of our anniversary after eating the room service breakfast.
644	0		My husband and I stayed at the Marriott in Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights in Feb. We had wanted to stay at the downtown Marriott (since we were staying on Marriott points) but it was not available.

904	1		Overall I thought it was a good hotel, no problems with service.

275	0		I got a room on the &quot; quiet&quot; side -- and it was, even though the Mayflower is in the heart of the city, between Union Square and Nob Hill.
63	0		SO you have Chancellor Hotel!!
13	0		we stayed in the omni for just one night at the end of a long holiday , there's no denying the rooms were spotless, the hotel beautiful and the staff super attentive.
326	0		I've lived in SF, so I'm used to the business/tourist areas of the cities and this area is just typical of that type of area.
441	1		The location was close to everything.
830	1		This isn't the best hotel, but you pay for what you get and we believe it was good value for money.
631	0		The staff was friendly, although i know the area and didnt need to ask for directions or restaurant reccommendations.
451	0		We were on the lower floors so there was no real view but ample sunlight in mornings nevertheless.

874	1		The hotel's location is GREAT!
986	0		We were finally buzzed in.
848	0		There are an excessive amount of homeless people and interesting individuals wandering around at all times during the night.

135	1		The location was ideal, and afternoon wine was nice too.

39	0		Yogurt, croissants, fruit salad, hard boiled eggs, and bottled water &amp; coffee were available.
389	0		We had a 3rd floor king w/ city view , nice view however if you open the windows the noise from Lombard Street is very loud , once closed noise barley audiable.
383	1		The location is excellent - close enough to the sights of the city but not in the middle of the rush.
47	0		The waitress said the chef prefers to serve the pork rare, probably because he has never heard of trichinosis and has no idea how easy it is to cook a pork tenderloin to non-pink, tender perfection.
897	0		Many families seem to stay in this hotel.
961	1		Used to live in the neighborhood, so I think it has a great location-- easy access to MUNI, BART, good restaurants within walking distance, walked to the Castro, Hayes Valley, Mission district, SOMA, SF Opera and Symphony.
559	0		So if it happens to be hot in SF as it was in the high 90's when we were there, the room will be hot.
29	0		We booked a deluxe King room, and were upgraded upon arrival to the King Suite for free.

194	1		Service was for Room Service (good food!), Valet parking and Housekeeping.
66	0		It's old, it rattles, but it's so much fun - those free cookies were lovely, and we should have taken the stairs, but that Elevator was too exciting to turn down!
590	0		Milk and half-and-half were served, too.
190	0		We could even have a drink or order soup or lite fare during our meetings.

0	0		Had a 1 bedroom on the second floor (#214) with huge balcony overlooking Alcatraz and Ghirardelli Square.
225	0		I am not sure why it was skipped here but it is a significant shortcoming in my book. I have stayed in a total of 6 hotels in San Fran.
64	0		Bathroom amneties were nice, and we stole the rubber ducky from our room for a little souvenier.

899	0		buses reaslly good and efficient - about every 7 or 8 mins.
96	0		This didn't bother me at all, but it might bother some people.

100	0		Overall, we enjoyed this hotel.
598	1		The only exception was a waiter at the Top of the Mark bar late one evening that sort of abandoned us.
374	0		Pros- Comfortable modern hotel (like all other Marriotts)- Nice beds and room decor (quiet with no street noise)- Lots of taxis right outside the door- Most rooms have a sofabed and either a King or 2 Queens so you can accomodate 3-4 adults in a pinch-Free internet access - staff were attentive, courteous and professionalCons- Location - too far from the happening Union square area and is consequently dead at night- Breakfast is not included so you're stuck with their overpriced buffet (avoid at all costs - the pastries were old and stale) or alternatively head into the Starbucks and grab a morning snack.
62	0		On the day that we wanted to buy the pass, it wasn't open at 9, and it wasn't open at 10, when we left the hotel for the day.
393	1		The courtyard, formerly where horses and buggies arrived, is stunning.

369	0		We were greeted by each hotel staff in sight.
688	1		The staff were all very helpful and we had a very pleasant stay.

464	0		Clean chairs, etc.
619	0		The only thing about valet parking (overnight) it cost $47!!!
758	0		The pictures on the website and the customer reviews create this image of a motel nestled in a quiet corner of the Marina district, but this is not true.
416	0		I truly recommend the Mosser.
684	0		In fact, we requested a roll away bed in our room with 2 full size beds and were told that the hotel does not have roll away beds anymore.

222	0		I could keep going and going about how wonderful the stay was but i would rather people go check it out for themselves.
458	0		That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with how enjoyable my stay was.
290	0		Although the televisions were standard 1980 floor models and had no recent payper-view movies, they offered over fifty cable channels, including lots of kid-friendly options.
962	0		The public parking lot was less than 2 blocks away (not long blocks but if toting a lot of luggage this could be an issue - no place on the street to pull over while you check in and drop off luggage).
651	1		The concierge was helpful and the GrandViews bar at the top of the hotel was spectacular.
127	1		The hotels windows, which opened quite a bit, appeared to be new and were a nice feature.
84	0		Normally that wouldn't bother me if the food was good, but it was not.
665	0		The door to the room entered into the poorly lit, narrow sitting area (I figured 8' X 10'), in which was crammed a desk w/ chair, mini-refrigerator, daybed/couch, and another chair and endtable.
165	1		The lobby is enormous and beautiful.
504	0		Japan town is such a wonderful place to explore.

519	1		Bus route was 2 blocks away really easy to find also got a few taxis back in the evening from fishermans wharf which were about $10-$15.
858	0		The high end eateries are replaced with pawn shops and liquor stores.
614	0		There the accommodations were just better in many ways.
55	1		The room was large, clean, comfortable, and very light, with large windows that afforded a view of the SF skyline, and side windows that actually opened, providing welcome fresh air.
794	0		Stayed 5 nights late August, we were given a corner suite on the 19th floor what a lovely view of the bay bridge and harbour and I used starwood points for the room so it was free.
237	0		Yes, the room is small.
755	0		The view is fantastic but it only opened at 4pm and was shut by midnight.
826	0		Now for the bad: There was no fan except a quiet ceiling fan which meant that every noise was easily heard all night such as doors slamming, people in neighboring rooms and street noise.
264	0		Still high but more reasonable then the hotel and most of the lots in the city.
134	0		The rooms reminded me of a sophisticated and hip city apartment from the40's or 50's complete with nice art on the walls and a cd player and cd's of San Francisco jazz artists.
309	0		Although we enjoyed our stay at the Tuscan Inn it wasn't all I'd hoped it would be.
303	0		We arrived before check-in time, but it was no problem parking in the adjacent structure, and the bellman came right to our van to take our luggage to storage.
429	1		Overall the facilities were above and beyond what we'd hoped for.
722	0		Toured as much as we could before we had to board our ship. Ate down at the Fisherman's Wharf (Neptunes Palace) for a lovely meal with a great view of Alcatraz at night.
274	0		Only mishap was that one of the reception staff blocked our credit card through swiping it when the system had asked to call for verification.

191	0		I was pretty tired
956	0		It was dimly lit, probably because it was missing a lamp.
438	1		The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful.
463	0		The noise was terrible.
357	0		. Tried to stay again apon my return to San Francisco unfortunately booked up!
568	1		Proximity to Union Square, Nob Hill and all the other sights is great, and a BART station is across the street.
951	0		The hotel was located four blocks from any life with crossing the homeless everyday to get there rather unnerving at times.
784	0		We were in town looking at colleges.
350	0		The hotel is new and shows no wear and tear yet.

509	0		We booked with one of the King Kabuki Rooms, and we don't regret it one bit!
71	0		You can't beat the fireplace for unwinding.
839	0		Happily, the non-smoking room had no trace of smoke smell, unlike other places I have stayed.
653	0		By this I don't mean just a &quot; hello&quot; and then go away but a real conversaion.
108	0		I am not a Ritz Carlton cheerleader.
931	0		We booked a queen cozy with an inner window and had aquiet, albeit small room, but who hangs around in their room in a city like San Francisco?
528	0		Maybe that is just a temporary situation, but my pasta would not have been very good cold and I didn't feel comfortable intruding on the employees to warm my food.
751	0		One of the concierge answered an outside call when we were in the middle of talking to him.
704	0		I was staying in San Francisco at the same time a few people I had just met were, and they were all paying significantly (30- 50%) less at their hotels than I was at the Savoy.
776	0		the hotel itself seems okay but the room i stayed in was absolutely tiny and i kept mistaking the bathroom for a closet.

743	1		It is perfectly situated right on Union Square.
147	0		We stayed in a Deluxe Waterview Room.

939	1		We found the motel very clean and the shower had a powerful water stream.
489	0		Despite the early start for any city in the morning, we did not notice any unexpected or overly loud noise problems, especially being in the heart of the city. We would definitely return.
500	0		This one is actually built into the rest of the surrounding buildings, with a single (for lack of a better term) garage door opening up into the city street.
882	0		Over the course of our one night stay we found that we had been fooled.
17	0		But, one person was extra special--Lex.
223	0		The staff were professional and helpful in our interactions with them, but - due to the way the hotel is set up - it was mainly just the doormen that we encountered.
514	0		Many writers complained about the noise.

935	1		It is an exceptional hotel for the price.
836	1		Its great fun and very reasonably priced.
584	0		I had read that you needed to be quick with the breakfast but that was not our experience.
769	0		Instead of broad pedestrian spaces with plenty of maneuvering options, you are sharing a narrow sidewalk and it is much harder to give the homeless a wide berth.
169	0		I found that to be a bit strange.
724	1		The bar gets pretty busy with sophisticated types :) so it's the perfect scene for socialising and getting to know the city life, great experience.
277	0		There are many hotels/motels in SF in better areas for this price or less.
494	1		This price is absolutely reasonable.
597	0		They have a great air and heat system in each room as well as a lighted display of &quot; do not disturb&quot; or &quot; please make up room&quot;.I would recommend highly recommend this hotel.
833	1		The closet had nice wooden hangers and there were about 12 of them, which was very useful.
998	0		When i parked right in front by a meter, a homeless man knocked on my window and asked me if i needed any &quot; aids&quot; refering to drugs.
987	0		Unitl, I pulled back the bed covers to find the Knights' Inn signature 'hair in the bed'.
52	1		It's quieter during the work week but spikes on the weekends.
391	1		A hidden bonus is the dry sauna located next to the indoor pool.
747	0		One of the best pieces of advice he gave was to park in the structure behind the hotel at a fraction of the cost of the ridiculously overpriced hotel parking.
175	1		The staff were very friendly and fun, and we really enjoyed the complimentary drinks at 5pm every evening.
22	1		Not only were the rooms immaculate, the bathrooms were so clean you could eat off the floor.
335	1		Location is perfect - two blocks to Fishermans Wharf, and two blocks to Cable Cars which will take you to many tourist locales.
310	1		It was reasonable and close to Fisherman's Wharf.
280	0		If this hotel was not next to such a rough part of Eddy St it would have been perfect, but then I am sure it would have been twice the price!
638	0		So if you like Lamb Andouille Sausage Pizza and Beet Salad for a late night snack when you've just flown in from New York, you might like this.
358	1		High floor, very quiet, pretty nice amenities.
677	1		The location is fantastic.
457	0		They did, however, offer a free pass to a gym a few blocks away, but neither my partner nor I wanted to hike our stuff up there and back.
531	0		We had a standard King room.
12	0		What I didn't get was the fact that they charge for the limo from the airport to the hotel some 130 bucks but when we asked for a cab from the hotel to the airport they offered the hotel limo for a flat fee of $50 -&gt; so you somehow feel ripped off about the first ride...If we would go to SF again we will definitely check other 4 star+ hotels aswell and try to find a good deal with some of the more well known brands.

53	1		The beds were comfortable and the rooms nice and clean.
394	0		I travel to San Francisco for business.

518	0		The elevator WAS working.
207	0		This experience was just the opposite of my first stay.
487	1		The buffet breakfast was simple and well done plus you can order eggs, pancakes or waffels your way, no extra charge.
810	0		We never got around to actually staying here.
765	1		Hotel Metropolis is a tastefully done urban hotel with a really cool urban soul food restaurant attached to it called Farmer Brown.
227	0		I would recommend a room on the Market Street side of the hotel - the other side is considered 'Bay View' but to me looks more like a ship yard.
840	0		It is a good solution if you're looking for a cheap solution in a central area (other luxury hotels are located nearby), and a good deal for the money you spend since you're really close to lots of areas of interest.
83	0		We came back one afternoon to find a complementary bottle of champagne in the room as we had mentioned to the doorman that we were in town for our own wedding in a few days.

988	0		Met hookers in the hallways.
612	0		My husband and I have been traveling in CA for the last 3 weeks.
110	0		Our room was extremely spacious and comfortable, and on the rare occasion that we used room-service, this was quick and efficient.
795	1		The shower head was great!
431	0		It was a lucky stroke to find this hotel and an even luckier stroke to get a room on a Friday without a reservation.
163	1		Restaurant was a little pricey but food and service were great.
381	1		Room was a good size (although beds were rather firm), we had a nice view of the bay bridge, free breakfast in Jasmine's which was decent.
657	0		The F-Line is in front of Walgreens, which is across the street.
592	0		We traveled into San Francisco for the evening, staying at the Mark Hopkins for one night.
545	1		Concierge service is very useful and the location ( a couple of blocks from Powell St cablecar and Union Square) is good.
600	0		Next to the elevators was a candy wrapper which was never removed during out 15 hour stay.
285	1		Would recommend the Phoenix if you want a to meet a broad range of fellow travellers &amp; experience another side of San Francisco.
81	0		All in all, we had a great time and would definitely stay at the Hotel Monaco next time we are in town.
430	1		I don't want to give away all the surprises but let's just say when they renovated and decorated this place, they went the extra mile on creativity.
942	0		I would certainly stay here again above all other hotels in this price range, and have already referred a few others.
678	0		cash and manually open the gate.
907	0		However, the breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was plentiful and rather inexpensive.
662	1		I can't fault the location of the hotel which was in easy walking distance of Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz Ferry, Cable car turnaround (where you could catch a cable car all the way into downtown area), The Cannery etc etc.
130	1		The location was great.
741	0		I was there for 4 nights, and charged for 6 days of internet service (double charged on two of the days) as though they didn't make enough revenue on my room.
686	0		The valet service also uses this lot.
694	0		This past Easter Break (April 2004) my family and I stayed at the Sheraton in Fisherman's Wharf for a part of our week long stay in San Francisco.
819	1		The security was very good.
526	1		This is a good hotel in an excellent location.
405	0		They always said &quot; Hi!&quot; when I entered the lobby - I felt like I belonged there.
963	0		We won't be in the room except to sleep, anyways.
697	0		I'm an unashamed carnivore but my partner is vegetarian and this was manna from heaven for her.
437	0		Newly renovated.
2	1		There is a reason why this is one of the best hotels in San Fran - it is a really fabulous place to stay.
527	1		The conceirge was very helpful with directions and questions we asked him.
541	0		We actually returned the rental car earlier and explored S. F. without it.
943	0		Unfortunately, most of the other hotels in the area we wanted were all booked and we didn't want to pay an arm and a leg, so we stayed here.
625	0		She made suggestion about tours, etc.
380	1		It was a nice walk down to the Ferry Building for a casual dinner and an easy walk to MOMA.
739	0		We found the hotel staff and the hotel itself to be very unaccomodating (with the exception of the Concierge-they were very helpful), cold, and unwelcoming.
867	1		the best thing about this hotel is its convenient location.
877	0		Two minor things: lighting was poor and water pressure was low.
77	0		The rooms are pretty small but nicely decorated.
200	0		Also, if you are into the night club scene...check out Butter.
554	0		We have NEVER experienced this poor of service.
