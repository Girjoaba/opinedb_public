Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good B-OP
place B-AS
, O
but O
not B-OP
any I-OP
longer I-OP
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude B-OP
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
lousy B-OP
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny B-OP
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

Avoid B-OP
this O
place B-AS
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously B-OP
good I-OP
. O

Saul B-AS
is O
the O
best B-OP
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
duck B-AS
confit I-AS
is O
always O
amazing B-OP
and O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
terrine I-AS
with I-AS
figs I-AS
was O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
interesting B-OP
and O
has O
many O
good B-OP
values I-OP
. O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
can O
not O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed B-OP
with O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
okay B-OP
, O
nothing B-OP
great I-OP
. O

Chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry B-OP
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy B-OP
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

I/we O
will O
never B-OP
go I-OP
back I-OP
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish B-AS
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad B-OP
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great B-OP
! O

Service B-AS
was O
devine B-OP
, O
oysters B-AS
where O
a O
sensual B-OP
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-AS
Saul I-AS
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
, O
the O
decor B-AS
cool B-OP
and O
understated B-OP
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-AS
breast I-AS
special I-AS
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible B-OP
. O

Ca O
n't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
' O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
average B-OP
... O
the O
Thai B-AS
fusion I-AS
stuff I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
here O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed B-OP
was O
their O
Grilled B-AS
Chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
Edamame I-AS
Puree I-AS
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative B-OP
and O
tasty B-OP
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
night B-OP
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un-appetizing B-OP
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek B-OP
and O
modern B-OP
. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru O
's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru O
's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing O
. O

What O
's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

Their O
sake B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive B-OP
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

The O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good B-OP
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome B-OP
, O
great B-OP
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great B-OP
! O

we O
love B-OP
th O
pink B-AS
pony I-AS
. O

THe O
perfect B-OP
spot B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
- O
awesome B-OP
. O

Service B-AS
- O
friendly B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
. O

Ambiance B-AS
- O
relaxed B-OP
and O
stylish B-OP
. O

Do O
n't O
judge O
this O
place B-AS
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience O
. O

( O
i O
hang O
out O
, O
and O
live O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood.. O
) O

the O
food B-AS
is O
decent B-OP
. O

however O
, O
it O
's O
the O
service B-AS
that O
leaves O
a O
bad B-OP
taste I-OP
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self-respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i.e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad B-OP
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

well O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

This O
place B-AS
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best B-OP
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

Service B-AS
is O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-AS
urchin I-AS
, O
which O
was O
heavenly B-OP
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
seemed O
pretty O
fresh B-OP
and O
was O
adequately B-OP
proportioned I-OP
. O

The O
rice B-AS
to I-AS
fish I-AS
ration I-AS
was O
also O
good B-OP
-- O
they O
did O
n't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-AS
price I-AS
sushi I-AS
deal I-AS
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted B-OP
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
well B-OP
prepared I-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
impecable B-OP
. O

I O
'm O
going O
back O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it O
's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive B-OP
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
far O
better B-OP
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive B-OP
and O
well O
priced O
. O

The O
Prix B-AS
Fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
worth B-OP
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
) O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend B-OP
it O
! O

I O
've O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

It O
is O
terrific B-OP
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty B-OP
food B-AS
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh B-OP
and O
continually O
refilled O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
were O
great B-OP
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
is O
rather O
good B-OP
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

I O
like B-OP
the O
somosas B-AS
, O
chai B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chole B-AS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-AS
and O
dhal B-AS
were O
kinda O
disappointing B-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice B-OP
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

The O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow B-OP
. O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-AS
spicy- O
its O
rather O
bland B-OP
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
pretty B-OP
and O
nice B-OP
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

If O
you O
've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-AS
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great B-OP
service B-AS
and O
great B-OP
food B-AS
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great B-OP
evening O
. O

The O
lava B-AS
cake I-AS
dessert I-AS
was O
incredible B-OP
and O
I O
recommend B-OP
it O
. O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-AS
, O
you O
're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off-the-beaten B-OP
path O
Parisian O
bistro O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-AS
is O
as O
cozy B-OP
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average B-OP
to I-OP
above-average I-OP
; O
the O
French B-AS
Onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive B-OP
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not O
brilliant B-OP
in O
any O
way O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-AS
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
delivered O
cold B-OP
and O
the O
cheese B-AS
was O
n't O
even O
fully O
melted B-OP
! O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
overpriced B-OP
and O
soggy B-OP
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy B-OP
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy B-OP
ingredients B-AS
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good B-OP
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

I O
think O
I O
've O
had O
some O
the O
best B-OP
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

The O
seafood B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
, O
there O
's O
a O
good B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing B-OP
menu B-AS
always O
offers O
some O
great B-OP
surprises O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh B-OP
ingredients B-AS
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual B-OP
but O
really O
delicious B-OP
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

Best B-OP
Pastrami B-AS
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great B-OP
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

And O
I O
've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-AS
shrimp I-AS
which O
are O
huge B-OP
and O
loved B-OP
it O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed B-OP
at O
this O
place B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
the O
most O
Japanese B-OP
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

The O
signs B-AS
, O
the O
specials B-AS
menus I-AS
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese B-OP
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
worth B-OP
an O
one-hour O
drive O
. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

Leon B-AS
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
: O
casual B-OP
but O
hip B-OP
, O
with O
well B-OP
prepared I-OP
basic O
French B-AS
bistro I-AS
fare I-AS
, O
good B-OP
specials B-AS
, O
a O
warm B-OP
and O
lively B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy B-OP
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly B-OP
, O
staff B-AS
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather O
; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter O
. O

Decent B-OP
wine B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-AS
Pomodori I-AS
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite B-OP
place B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
, O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
great B-OP
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
comes O
in O
large B-OP
portions B-AS
. O

You O
'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
do O
n't O
compare O
. O

I O
'm O
partial B-OP
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-AS
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
incredibly O
tiny B-OP
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
is O
rude B-OP
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
oily I-OP
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype O
... O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short B-OP
wait B-AS
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great B-OP
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
while O
we O
waited O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great B-OP
and O
fast B-OP
service B-AS
. O

The O
people B-AS
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly B-OP
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often B-OP
as O
you O
can O
. O

This O
is O
a O
fun B-OP
restaurant B-AS
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
yummy B-OP
and O
I O
like B-OP
the O
atmoshpere B-AS
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
way O
to O
expensive B-OP
. O

A O
large O
is O
$ O
20 O
, O
and O
toppings O
are O
about O
$ O
3 O
each O
. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good B-OP
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read O
. O

Sauce B-AS
was O
watery B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
was O
very O
patient B-OP
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
phenomenal B-OP
! O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt B-OP
, O
friendly B-OP
and O
great B-OP
. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it O
! O

Great B-OP
pizza B-AS
and O
fantastic B-OP
service B-AS
. O

There O
was O
a O
small B-OP
wait B-AS
, O
but O
shorter B-OP
than O
I O
expected O
. O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O
.. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best B-OP
sushi B-AS
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small B-OP
and O
cramped B-OP
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic B-OP
. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-AS
of I-AS
gari I-AS
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

Planet B-AS
Thailand I-AS
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit B-OP
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
which O
is O
great B-OP
, O
the O
thai B-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
too O
. O

With O
the O
great B-OP
variety I-OP
on O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
n't O
the O
greatest B-OP
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

It O
's O
all O
about O
the O
food B-AS
! O
! O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-AS
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
there O
were O
n't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

those O
rolls B-AS
were O
big B-OP
, O
but O
not O
good B-OP
and O
sashimi B-AS
was O
n't O
fresh B-OP
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
did O
n't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

Hurley O
's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-AS
tuna I-AS
, O
it O
is O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
enough O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy B-OP
their O
garden B-AS
terrace I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt B-OP
and O
helpful B-OP
, O
but O
not O
over-bearing B-OP
or O
rushed B-OP
. O

The O
Steak B-AS
Tartare I-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
bet O
, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-AS
were O
rather O
warm B-OP
, O
but O
the O
open B-AS
kitchen I-AS
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm B-OP
. O

Great B-OP
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
, O
Gigondas B-AS
is O
worth B-OP
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B-AS
champagne I-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
value I-OP
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
it O
is O
the O
best B-OP
French B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Have O
recommended B-OP
the O
place B-AS
to O
friends O
, O
always O
gets O
good B-OP
response O
. O

Pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza B-AS
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings O
- O
the O
crust B-AS
tastes O
like O
the O
best B-OP
, O
freshly B-OP
baked I-OP
bread O
! O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy O
's O
! O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
! O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT O
's O
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great B-OP
neighborhood B-AS
and O
has O
great B-OP
food B-AS
! O

I O
've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend B-OP
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
-- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate B-OP
setting B-AS
and O
nice B-OP
service B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy B-OP
Mizu B-AS
very O
much O
... O
and O
we O
're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy O
Scallop O
roll.. O
. O

it O
's O
delicious O
! O

Moules B-AS
were O
excellent B-OP
, O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
was O
VERY O
salty B-OP
! O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother O
's O
Day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre O
d O
' O
was O
pretty O
rude B-OP
. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere O
, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved O
. O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting O
. O

Tiny O
dessert B-AS
was O
$ O
8.00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced B-OP
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

The O
drinks B-AS
are O
always O
well B-OP
made I-OP
and O
wine B-AS
selection I-AS
is O
fairly B-OP
priced I-OP
. O

Try O
their O
chef O
's O
specials O
-- O
they O
are O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
exactly O
five B-OP
star I-OP
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

Downstairs B-AS
lounge I-AS
is O
always O
a O
good B-OP
attraction I-OP

Raga O
's O
is O
a O
romantic B-OP
, O
cozy B-OP
restaurant O
. O

The O
exotic B-AS
food I-AS
is O
beautifully B-OP
presented I-OP
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious B-OP
combinations O
. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
incredibly O
helpful B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
. O

The O
bar B-AS
is O
very O
well B-OP
stocked I-OP
with O
interesting B-OP
beers B-AS
and O
well B-OP
priced I-OP
wines B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-AS
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend O
's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

Rude B-OP
service B-AS
, O
medicore B-OP
food B-AS
... O
there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY O
... O
stay O
away O
from O
this O
one O

I O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time I-OP
at O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
! O

I O
loved B-OP
everythig O
about O
it-especially O
the O
shows B-AS
and O
actors B-AS
. O

Our O
server B-AS
was O
very O
helpful B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
too O
. O

The O
tuna B-AS
and O
wasabe B-AS
potatoes I-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
. O

The O
outdoor B-AS
atmosphere I-AS
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful B-OP
. O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
prompt B-OP
and O
courteous B-OP
. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we O
'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
. O

Great B-OP
service B-AS
, O
great B-OP
food B-AS
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down O
. O

But O
too O
far O
east O
! O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy O
's O
frequently O
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-AS
mozzarella I-AS
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria O
's O
. O

Two O
complaints- O
their O
appetizer B-AS
selection I-AS
stinks B-OP
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
blantently O
unappreciative B-OP
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best B-OP
pie B-AS
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

By O
far O
the O
best B-OP
salad B-AS
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

fine B-OP
dining B-AS
restaurant O
quality O
. O

Over O
100 O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own O
. O

A O
must O
try O
! O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great B-OP
restaurant B-AS
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet O
, O
relaxing O
, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater O
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
pot I-AS
pie I-AS
is O
exceptional B-OP
, O
the O
cheeseburger B-AS
huge B-OP
and O
delictable B-OP
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
professional B-OP
wan O
warm O
. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid-town O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
no O
nonsense B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
options O
rule O
. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-AS
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better B-OP
than O
any O
else O
. O

Worth B-OP
visiting O
the O
1st B-AS
Ave I-AS
spot I-AS
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L.A O
. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O
) O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-AS
Hand I-AS
roll I-AS
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN B-OP
! O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O

an O
assortment O

including O
Fatty O
Yellow O

Boton O
Shrimp O
, O
Blue O
Fin O
Torro O
( O
Fatty O

The O
sake B-AS
menu I-AS
should O
not O
be O
overlooked B-OP
! O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-AS
teriyaki I-AS
and O
the O
rose B-AS
special I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
- O
prompt B-OP
, O
attentive B-OP
and O
non-intrusive B-OP
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt-in-your-mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
selection I-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
wine-by-the-glass B-AS
was O
generously B-OP
filled I-OP
to O
the O
top O
. O

Traditional B-AS
French I-AS
decour I-AS
was O
pleasant B-OP
though O
the O
hall B-AS
was O
rather O
noisy B-OP
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-AS
Spice I-AS
probably O
5-8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best B-OP
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-AS
varies O
from O
good B-OP
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average B-OP
Ok I-OP
. O

Seating B-AS
is O
always O
prompt B-OP
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
usually O
very O
good B-OP
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered B-OP
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-AS
vegatables I-AS
in I-AS
side I-AS
orders I-AS
. O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
is O
vibrant B-OP
and O
eye-pleasing B-OP
with O
several O
semi-private B-AS
boths I-AS
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great B-OP
for O
a O
date O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed B-OP
in O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken B-OP
by O
the O
live B-AS
jazz I-AS
band I-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad O
. O

I O
've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best B-OP
meal B-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong B-OP
at O
the O
Red B-AS
Eye I-AS
Grill I-AS
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss B-OP
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

We O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
cute B-OP
but O
not O
upscale B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
a O
diamond B-OP
in O
rough O
-- O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
homemade B-OP
with O
the O
perfect B-OP
balance B-AS
of I-AS
herbs I-AS
and I-AS
tomatoes I-AS
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

It O
's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time I-OP
at O
the O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
hyde I-AS
Pub I-AS
last O
night O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O
. O

After O
really O
enjoying B-OP
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

The O
server B-AS
was O
really O
cool B-OP
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
place O
's O
decor B-AS
and O
hidden B-AS
bathrooms I-AS
made O
for O
a O
good B-OP
laugh O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-AS
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great B-OP
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
Pub I-AS
for O
our O
anniversary O
, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic B-OP
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-AS
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend B-OP
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-AS
tortelini I-AS
. O

The O
entertainment B-AS
was O
great B-OP
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice O
, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem O
. O

The O
bagel B-AS
was O
huge B-OP
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-AS
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy B-OP
) O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND O
. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicious B-OP
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12 O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh B-OP
lobster B-AS
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed B-OP
pizza B-AS
, O
santa B-AS
fe I-AS
chopped I-AS
salad I-AS
and O
fish B-AS
and I-AS
chips I-AS
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
for O
their O
food B-AS
, O
the O
ambience B-AS
and O
wonderful B-OP
service B-AS
. O

All O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
absolutely O
professional B-OP
! O
! O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
do O
n't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
... O
) O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
, O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT O
. O

There O
's O
nice O
and O
quiet O
, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
( O
or O
more O
) O
. O

This O
restaurant B-AS
was O
way O
overhyped B-OP
. O

My O
chow B-AS
fun I-AS
and I-AS
chow I-AS
see I-AS
was O
really O
bland B-OP
and O
oily B-OP
. O

Okay-i O
do O
n't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

The O
scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS
and O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
were O
nothing B-OP
out I-OP
of I-OP
the I-OP
ordinary I-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good B-OP
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

It O
's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-AS
was O
pretty O
below B-OP
average I-OP
... O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
soggy B-OP
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-AS
had O
no B-OP
flavor I-OP
. O

I O
definitely O
would O
n't O
go O
back O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

Their O
pad B-AS
penang I-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic B-OP
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor B-OP
. O

fresh B-AS
restaurant I-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
... O
... O
.. O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
and O
of O
course O
fresh B-OP
. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends O
... O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

Hats B-OP
off I-OP
to O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

the O
salads B-AS
are O
delicious B-OP
, O
both O
refreshing B-OP
and O
very O
spicy B-OP
. O

We O
had O
Pam O
's O
special O
fried O
fish O
and O
it O
was O
amazing B-OP
. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

Unbelievable O
. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

Great B-OP
vibe B-AS
, O
lots O
of O
people O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
, O
medium O
. O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect O
, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked B-OP
the O
atmosphere B-AS
so O
much O
. O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off O
. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews O
. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch O
. O

Ambience B-AS
is O
so O
cute B-OP
and O
quaint B-OP
, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

Salads B-AS
were O
fantastic B-OP
. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-AS
we O
got O
were O
great B-OP
. O

Ingredients B-AS
are O
organic B-OP
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus B-OP
for O
me O
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good B-OP
, O
inexpensive B-OP
sushi B-AS
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that O
's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
Tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
is O
huge B-OP
and O
probably O
the O
best B-OP
that O
I O
've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

The O
Yellowtail B-AS
was O
particularly O
good B-OP
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
deal I-AS
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited B-OP
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-AS
I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

Big B-AS
Wong I-AS
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine B-OP
establishment O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
-- O
great B-OP
price O
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
service B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
noisy B-OP
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast B-OP
as O
they O
can O
. O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-AS
, O
noodles B-AS
, O
and O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3-6 O
each O
) O
. O

The O
takeout B-AS
is O
great B-OP
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
always O
very O
crowded B-OP
and O
popular B-OP
. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend O
's O
reccomendation O
. O

Enjoyed B-OP
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-AS
Salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-AS
and I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
... O
.both O
very O
tasty B-OP
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely B-OP
and O
fresh B-OP
. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate I-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious B-OP
. O

We O
'd O
go O
back O
again O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing B-OP
time I-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating B-OP
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely B-OP
. O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-AS
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying B-OP
ourselves O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good B-OP
food B-AS
and O
ok B-OP
service B-AS
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad B-OP
food B-AS
and O
bad B-OP
service B-AS
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good B-AS
good B-AS
and O
bad B-OP
service B-AS
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck O
! O

The O
place O
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
: O
simple B-OP
dishes B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
served O
efficiently B-OP
in O
a O
bustling B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-AS
go O
wrong O
; O
no O
where O

You O
are O
not O
eating O

Steake O
Fritte O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-AS
is O
simply O
wonderful B-OP
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
cozy B-OP
place B-AS
with O

but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-AS
was O
kind O
of O
bitter B-OP
though O
) O
. O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
tasted O
better B-OP
. O

The O

pretty O
tasty B-OP
and O
good B-OP
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small B-OP
place B-AS
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-AS
beer I-AS
which O
was O
big B-OP
enough O
for O
two O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka-masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O
. O

MMmmm O
... O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow B-OP
, O
but O
the O
people B-AS
were O
friendly B-OP
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice B-OP
place B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
authentic B-OP
Italian O
- O
delicious B-OP
! O

Pizza B-AS
is O
terrific B-OP
, O
as O
is O
homemade B-AS
pasta I-AS
. O

Ambience B-AS
is O
delightful B-OP
, O
service B-AS
impeccable B-OP
. O

I O
'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy B-OP
food B-AS
. O

The O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
was O
like O
rubber B-OP
and O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
flavorless B-OP
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
horrible B-OP
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
is O
not O
that O
great B-OP
. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you O
're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-AS
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

The O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
superb B-OP
! O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

It O
's O
a O
small B-OP
cute B-OP
restaurant B-AS
. O

I O
absolutely O
love B-OP
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O
! O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

I O
like B-OP
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
it O
's O
very O
dark O
and O
original O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend O
's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
! O
! O
! O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

Big O
thumbs O
up O
! O

Very O
affordable B-OP
and O
excellent B-OP
ambient B-AS
! O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-AS
and I-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good B-OP
meal B-AS
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
good B-OP
hang O
out O
spot O
. O

Next O
time O
, O
we O
would O
n't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks O
. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time I-OP
! O

THe O
Pizza B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
were O
excellent B-OP
- O
the O
service B-AS
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-AS
dining I-AS
area I-AS
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest B-OP
outdoor B-AS
restaurants I-AS
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
-- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

Check O
this O
place B-AS
out O
! O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
*not* O
romantic B-OP
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch O
's O
editorial O
review O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

The O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close B-OP
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical B-OP
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced B-OP
. O

Slightly O
above B-OP
average I-OP
wines B-AS
start O
at O
$ O
70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30+ O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect B-OP
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
... O
. O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper B-OP
service B-AS
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming B-OP
factor I-OP
was O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
above B-OP
average I-OP
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies B-OP
of O
Teodora B-AS
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday O
, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-AS
was O
edible B-OP
- O
bland B-OP
and/or O
made O
with O
weird B-OP
rosemary B-AS
or I-AS
orange I-AS
flavoring I-AS
. O

Fish B-AS
was O
overdone B-OP
. O

Cute B-OP
place B-AS
, O
nice B-OP
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended B-OP
the O
dessert B-AS
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked B-OP
the O
expresso B-AS
- O
that O
's O
it O
. O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B-AS
, O
it O
's O
a O
big O
disappointment B-OP
. O

Myagi B-AS
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite B-OP
restaurants O
in O
the O
City O
; O
the O
place O
the O
negative O
reviews O
describe O
sound O
like O
they O
were O
somewhere O
else O
. O

I O
've O
never O
had O
bad B-OP
service B-AS
and O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
fresh B-OP
and O
delicious B-OP
. O

Their O
tuna B-AS
tartar I-AS
appetizer I-AS
is O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
almost O
ashamed B-OP
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-AS
in O
Fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
so O
cool B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt B-OP
and O
curtious B-OP
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B-AS
a O
try O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

P.S O
. O
Please O
do O
n't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O
. O

LOL O

A O
restaurant O
that O
does O
n't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great B-OP
food B-AS
with O
great B-OP
service B-AS
in O
a O
pleasant B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
-- O
the O
food B-AS
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

The O
dining B-AS
room I-AS
is O
quietly O
elegant B-OP
with O
no O
music O
to O
shout O
over O
-- O
how O
refreshing B-OP
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
impeccable B-OP
and O
unobtrusive B-OP
-- O
the O
staff B-AS
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
, O
present O
your O
meal O
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real B-OP
meal B-AS
in O
a O
real B-OP
restaurant B-AS
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

Beautiful O
experience O
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
breathtaking B-OP
the O
service B-AS
is O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
... O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
wonderful B-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
offers O
impeccable B-OP

I O
had O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
it O
has O
2 O
oz O

Lobster O
in O
it O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-AS
England I-AS
Chowder I-AS
it O
was O
good B-OP
but O
I O
think O
the O
award B-OP
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-AS
Bisque I-AS
. O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
Prime B-AS
Rib I-AS
it O
was O
good B-OP
. O

We O
did O
n't O
want O
a O
bottle O
of O
bubbly O
on O
a O
weekday O
so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles B-AS
of I-AS
Korbett I-AS
it O
was O
just O
enough B-OP
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

It O
's O
cuz O
it O
's O
so O
good O
you O
need O
to O
taste O
it O
! O

All O

here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-AS
. O

If O
you O
like B-OP
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B-AS
vindaloo I-AS
. O

It O
's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive O
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st B-OP
class I-OP
service B-AS
and O
terrific B-OP
food B-AS
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
large B-OP
and O
the O
servers O
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
... O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef O
's O
tasting O
menu O
and O
your O
favourite B-OP
bottle O
( O
or O
two O
! O
) O
of O
wine O
from O
an O
extensive B-OP
selection B-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
small B-OP
and O
intimate B-OP
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded B-OP
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
and O
it O
's O
great B-OP
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans O
. O

The O
food B-AS
can O
get O
pricey B-OP
but O
the O
prixe B-AS
fixe I-AS
tasting I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
the O
greatest B-OP
food B-AS
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food B-AS
to O
any O
food B-AS
allergies O
or O
food B-AS
you O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

Recommendations O
, O
of O
course O
, O
are O
required O
! O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it O
's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

With O
the O
exception B-OP
of O
our O
lemon B-AS
salad I-AS
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-AS
here O
was O
decent B-OP
, O
not O
great B-OP
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
very O
limited B-OP
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-AS
branzino I-AS
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult B-OP
to O
eat O
. O

The O
decor B-AS
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner-ish B-OP
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic B-OP
, O
just O
simple B-OP
, O
small O
and O
sparse B-OP
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-AS
is O
particularly O
memorable B-OP
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
so O
much O
fun B-OP
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible B-OP
entertainment B-AS
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Our O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
too O
! O

And O
really O
large B-OP
portions B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
the O
friendliest B-OP
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different B-OP
than O
try O
Jekyll B-AS
and I-AS
Hyde I-AS
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
pretty O
tradional B-OP
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good B-OP
with O
large B-OP
portions B-AS
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun B-OP
. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable B-OP
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect B-OP
. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-AS
and I-AS
Hydes I-AS
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun B-OP
to O
do O
once O
. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
slow B-OP
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Drinks B-AS
way O
over B-OP
priced I-OP
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
not O
great B-OP
not O
worth B-OP
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

Great B-OP
pizza B-AS
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
quick B-OP
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important O
. O

Have O
the O
iced O
tea O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Whenever O
you O

Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality B-OP
fish B-AS

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels O
. O

Ess-A-Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best B-OP
bagel B-AS
in O
NY O
. O

The O
bagels B-AS
always O
warm B-OP
, O
soft B-OP
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy B-OP
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous B-OP
in O
size O
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge B-OP
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-AS
are O
great B-OP
. O

The O
lox B-AS
is O
always O
fresh B-OP
too O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
either O
. O

Not O
impressed B-OP
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped B-OP
and O
unappealing B-OP
resturant B-AS
. O

Zero B-OP
ambiance B-AS
to O
boot O
. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-AS
was O
totally O
overrated B-OP
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
.but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
, O
but O
service B-AS
was O
n't O
so O
great B-OP
. O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
does O
n't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST B-OP
Shabu-Shabu B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
in O
the O
Try-State O
Area O
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-AS
and O
the O
feel B-AS
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves B-OP
Shabu-Shabu B-AS
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
nothing B-OP
special I-OP
, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds B-OP
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-AS
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited B-OP
menu B-AS
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh B-OP
and O
a O
work O
of O

This O

was O

by O
a O
local O
... O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

We O
were O
n't O
! O

The O
prices O
were O
CHEAP B-OP
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

The O
location B-AS
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
Ok B-OP
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

Try O
green B-AS
curry I-AS
with I-AS
vegetables I-AS
. O

The O
quantity B-AS
is O
also O
very O
good B-OP
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied B-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
ok B-OP
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
sat O
. O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

I O
had O
the O
best B-OP
ravioli B-AS
ever O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
too O
. O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

Molto O

This O
quaint B-OP
and O
romantic B-OP
trattoria B-AS
is O

the O

Ciao O
Bella O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
, O
service B-AS
and O
value O
exceptional B-OP
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
authentic B-OP
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
- O
friendly B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
. O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low O
. O

Very O
good B-OP
wine B-AS
choices I-AS
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best B-OP
pizza B-AS
in O
NYC O
! O

Get O
the O
pepperoni B-AS

YUM O

and O
a O

Great B-OP
staff B-AS
. O

Always O
great B-OP
service B-AS
! O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

Fantastic O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
lie O
. O

But O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
so O
horrible B-OP
to O
us O
. O

The O
hostess B-AS
and O
the O
waitress B-AS
were O
incredibly O
rude B-OP
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-AS
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
pricey B-OP
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
worth B-OP
it O
; O
but O
the O
service B-AS
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

I O
'll O
keep O
this O
short O
. O

Amma B-AS
is O
nothing B-OP
special I-OP
. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place O
. O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-AS
average B-OP
at I-OP
best I-OP
and O
too O
expensive B-OP
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up B-OP
to I-OP
par I-OP
with O
the O
non-veg B-AS
selections I-AS
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
though O
service B-AS
can O
be O
spotty B-OP
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
always O
packed B-OP
. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
. O

Try O
the O
sea B-AS
bass I-AS
. O

Highly O
recommended O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
Rocks O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by O
. O

but O
ive O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
yrs O
and O
finally O
decided O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-AS
was O
awsome B-OP
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

and O
yes O
Dal B-AS
Bukhara I-AS
is O
so O
dam O
good B-OP
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B-AS
. O

They O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
Yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O
new O

. O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O
10 O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations O

Haru B-AS
on I-AS
Park I-AS
S I-AS
is O
simply O
disgusting B-OP
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
not O
fresh B-OP
and O
the O
rice B-AS
tasted O
old B-OP
and O
stale B-OP
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst B-OP
sushi B-AS
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst B-OP
sushi B-AS
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we O
've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-AS
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly B-OP
. O

the O
all-u-can-eat B-AS
sushi I-AS
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor B-OP
quality I-OP
. O

limited B-OP
menu B-AS
, O
no-so-fresh B-OP
ingredients B-AS
, O
thinly-sliced B-OP
fish B-AS
, O
fall-apart B-OP
rice B-AS
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty B-OP
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
( O
even O
its O
low O
sodium O
) O
, O
the O
vinegar-soaked B-OP
rice B-AS
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B-AS
are O
nice B-OP
though O
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth O
's O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing B-OP
. O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed B-OP
by O
the O
service B-AS
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude B-OP
. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O

The O
dinner B-AS
was O
ok B-OP
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-AS
benedict I-AS
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst B-OP
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious B-OP
meal B-AS
in O
a O
beautiful B-OP
room B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive B-OP
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

Planet B-AS
Thai I-AS
is O
great B-OP
! O

We O
love B-OP
the O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
atmosphere B-AS
! O

The O
svc B-AS
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude B-OP
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
must B-OP
! O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS
Thai I-AS
, O
it O
's O
fabulous B-OP
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

Just O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
small B-OP
or O
the O
food B-AS
is O
nasty B-OP
, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT B-OP
! O

Just O
remember O
, O
the O
later O
you O
go O
, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
. O

It O
's O
popular O
w/the O
late O
crowd O
. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
did O
n't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
( O
nearing O
$ O
7 O
) O
did O
n't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side O
. O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
saves B-OP
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O

Chennai B-AS
Garden I-AS
is O
my O
favorite B-OP
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O

They O
have O
authentic B-OP
Indian B-AS
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN O
; O
there O
are O
NO O
MEAT B-AS
dishes I-AS
whatsoever O
. O

The O
seats B-AS
are O
uncomfortable B-OP
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

It O
's O
a O
rather O
cramped B-OP
and O
busy B-OP
restaurant B-AS
and O
it O
closes O
early O
. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice B-OP
cigar B-AS
bar I-AS
and O
has O
great B-OP
staff B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
tasty B-OP
and O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
are O
appropriate B-OP

This O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
restaurant B-AS
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O

Not O
a O
great B-OP

Mermaid B-AS
Inn I-AS
is O
an O
overall O
good B-OP
restaurant O
with O
really O
good B-OP
seafood B-AS
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
limited B-OP
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
the O
spaghetti B-AS
with I-AS
Scallops I-AS
and I-AS
Shrimp I-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
ambience B-AS
is O
good B-OP
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O
. O

The O
only O
fallback B-OP
on O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
the O
prices O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good B-OP
seafood B-AS
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

The O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good B-OP
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough B-OP
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
were O
n't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-AS
special I-AS
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-AS
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
top-notch B-OP
. O

When O
my O
dessert O
came O
, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive B-OP
waiter B-AS
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy B-OP
with O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

Why O
? O

They O
do O
n't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer O
's O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

please O
do O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

I O
recommend B-OP
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap B-OP
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice B-OP
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
can O
not O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent B-OP
. O

Cheese B-AS
plate I-AS
is O
a O
varied B-OP
delight I-OP
and O
great B-OP
bargain I-OP
at O
$ O
10 O
. O

The O
large B-OP
selection I-OP
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

( O
The O
asparagus B-AS
, O
truffle O
oil O
, O
parmesan O
bruschetta O
is O
a O
winner B-OP
! O
) O

Wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive B-OP
without O
being O
over-priced B-OP
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal O
, O
and O
always O
delicious B-OP
, O
specials B-AS
. O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

I O
loved B-OP
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
so O
great B-OP
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
, O
a O
great B-OP
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
its O
self O
was O
great B-OP
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
freindly B-OP
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly B-OP
little O
european O
town O
. O

I O
like B-OP
Cafe B-AS
Noir I-AS
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil B-OP
and O
incompetent B-OP
! O
! O

The O
service B-AS
was O
terrible B-OP
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
Where O
are O
you O
from O
... O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America O
... O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
waitress B-AS
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional B-OP
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-AS
Noir I-AS
would O
get O
some O
good B-OP
staff B-AS
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great B-OP
place O
. O

Pizza B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good B-OP
. O

Salads B-AS
are O
a O
delicious B-OP
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-AS
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy O
. O

Decor B-AS
is O
charming B-OP
. O

Service B-AS
is O
average B-OP
. O

What O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband O
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun B-OP
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty B-OP
. O

I O
was O
n't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like B-OP
thai B-AS
cuisine I-AS
! O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst B-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

A O
gentleman B-AS
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants O
, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald O
's O
, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O
's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

Never O
again O
! O

I O
absolutely O
Loved B-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

Excellent B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
delicious B-OP
dishes B-AS
good B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
service B-AS
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
NY O
Italian O
Food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
also O
really O
nice B-OP
. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8:30 O
. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful B-OP
; O
food B-AS
, O
drinks B-AS
, O
staff B-AS
, O
mileau B-AS
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend B-OP
this O
place B-AS
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time I-OP
there O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
did O
n't O
have O
my O
name O
. O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-AS
table I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
has O
been O
nice B-OP
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed B-OP
and O
the O
unisex B-AS
bathroom I-AS
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned B-OP
more O
often O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular B-OP
caviar B-AS
to O
the O
hospitable B-OP
waitstaff B-AS
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable B-OP
and O
relaxed B-OP
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious B-OP
top B-OP
grade I-OP
caviar B-AS
and O
fantastic B-OP
service B-AS
. O

Nice B-OP
Family O
owned O
traditional B-OP
restaurant B-AS
. O

Fresh B-OP
ingredients B-AS
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

Friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you O
're O
with O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
outstanding B-OP
, O
particulary B-OP
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
I O
had O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-AS
Mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
which O
was O
good B-OP
... O
not O
outstanding B-OP
, O
but O
good B-OP
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth B-OP
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool B-OP
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well B-OP
there O
. O

Overall O
, O
excellent B-OP
restaurant B-AS
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
and O
calm B-OP
. O

but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow B-OP
. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
buffet B-AS
had O
a O
nice B-OP
selection O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
average B-OP
or I-OP
above I-OP
including O
some O
surprising B-OP
tasty B-OP
dishes B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good B-OP
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent B-OP
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice B-OP
pastries B-AS
. O

I O
would O
recommend B-OP
Roxy O
's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted B-OP
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge B-OP
! O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-AS
fell B-OP
apart I-OP
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

I O
had O
a O
huge B-OP
pastrami B-AS
sandwich I-AS
on I-AS
a I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

It O
was O
$ O
14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami-but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
taste-I O
've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

This O
place B-AS
is O
really O
trendi B-OP
but O
they O
have O
forgotten B-OP
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-AS
was O
soo O
spicy B-OP
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-AS
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

And O
the O
Tom B-AS
Kha I-AS
soup I-AS
was O
pathetic B-OP
. O

If O
you O
want O
good B-OP
authentic B-OP
Thai B-AS
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed B-OP
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
pesto B-AS
pizza I-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
, O
thin-crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice B-OP
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
Italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O
I O
'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

THe O
back B-AS
garden I-AS
sitting I-AS
area I-AS
is O
very O
pleasant B-OP
, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-AS
sandwich I-AS
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC B-OP
. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-AS
was O
fine B-OP
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
were O
the O
best B-OP
he O
has O
had O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-AS
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B-AS
that O
were O
just O
right B-OP
. O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

love B-OP
the O
food B-AS
. O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy B-OP
authentic B-OP
japanese B-AS
comfort I-AS
food I-AS
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O

what O
to O
order O
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

highly O
recommended O

I O
've O
lived O
in O

years O

all O
. O

, O
good B-OP
size I-OP
menu B-AS
, O
great B-OP

and O
an O
unpretensious B-OP

. O

The O
dishes B-AS
offered O
were O
unique B-OP
, O
very O
tasty B-OP
and O
fresh B-OP
from O
the O
lamb B-AS
sausages I-AS
, O
sardines B-AS
with I-AS

( O
the O
best B-OP
and O
freshest B-OP
I O
've O
ever O

. O

I O
'm O
glad B-OP
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-AS
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O

types I-AS
of I-AS
sake I-AS
, O
and O
the O
banana B-AS

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great B-OP
spot B-AS
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

Average B-OP
to I-OP
good I-OP
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
but O
terrible B-OP
delivery B-AS
. O

I O
've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

A O
Thai B-AS
restaurant I-AS
out O
of O
rice O
during O
dinner O
? O

The O
food B-AS
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
I O
called O
, O
cold B-OP
and O
soggy B-OP
. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret O
. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful B-OP
place B-AS
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money O
. O

An O
excellent B-OP
service B-AS

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly B-OP
by O
the O
waiter B-AS
who O
was O
very O
nice B-OP
and O
cordial B-OP
. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good B-OP
dishes B-AS
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food O
. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry O
. O

The O
food B-AS
looked O
very O
appetizing B-OP
and O
delicious B-OP
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great B-OP
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-AS
Jamun I-AS
dessert I-AS
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-AS
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend B-OP
it O
to O
others O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
could O
n't O
get O
a O
table O
. O

Service B-AS
here O
was O
great B-OP
, O
food B-AS
was O
fantastic B-OP
. O

Guacamole B-AS
shrimp I-AS
appetizer I-AS
was O
really O
great B-OP
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
, O
very O
good B-OP
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-AS
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet B-AS
was O
so O
good B-OP
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again O
. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
; O
- O
) O

You O
can O
not O
go O
wrong B-OP
with O
this O
place B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
outstanding B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick B-OP
, O
friendly B-OP
and O
very O
professional B-OP
. O

Always O
a O
nice B-OP
crowd B-AS
, O
but O
never O
loud B-OP
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends O
. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
to O
become O
overcrowded B-OP
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best B-OP
pizza B-AS
in O
Manhattan O
. O

The O
crust B-AS
is O
thin B-OP
, O
the O
ingredients B-AS
are O
fresh B-OP
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh B-OP
. O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O
. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great B-OP
pizzeria B-AS
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-AS
are O
terrific B-OP
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better O
! O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
Sophia B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

It O
's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre B-OP
at I-OP
best I-OP
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible B-OP
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

We O
were O
n't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total O
. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter O
, O
we O
're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great B-OP
food B-AS
plus O
great B-OP
service B-AS
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID O
! O

I O
've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
outstanding B-OP
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland B-OP
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
I O
'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

The O
blond B-AS
wood I-AS
decor I-AS
is O
very O
soothing B-OP
, O
the O
premium B-AS
sake I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

Mizu B-AS
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy O
. O

While O
their O
kitchen B-AS
food I-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
, O
their O
Sushi B-AS
is O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative B-OP
and O
unique B-OP
rolls B-AS
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-AS
the O
best B-OP
around O
, O
the O
service B-AS
has O
always O
been O
attentive B-OP
and O
charming B-OP
. O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult B-OP
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-AS
! O

Thalia B-AS
is O
a O
beautiful B-OP
restaurant O
with O
beautiful B-OP
people B-AS
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
does O
n't O
quite O
match B-OP
up I-OP
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-AS
salmon I-AS
and I-AS
roe I-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
it O
was O
off B-OP
flavor I-OP
. O

The O
entree B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
and O
small B-OP
, O
dessert B-AS
was O
not O
inspired B-OP
. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive B-OP
menu B-AS
. O

The O
view B-AS
is O
spectacular B-OP
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

Wonderful B-OP
strawberry B-AS

to O
Battery O

! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Authentic B-OP
Taiwanese B-AS
food I-AS
that O
's O
cheap B-OP
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

( O
Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
) O
. O

The O
cold B-AS
appetizer I-AS
dishes I-AS
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

the O

on I-AS
saffron I-AS

My O

her O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatos I-AS
. O

Delicious B-OP
crab B-AS
cakes I-AS
too O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
this O
good B-OP
, O
the O
garden B-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

Great B-OP
neighborhood O
joint B-AS
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
with O
good B-OP
selection B-AS
of I-AS
thin I-AS
crust I-AS
pizza I-AS
including O
the O
Basil B-AS
slice I-AS
. O

Their O
calzones B-AS
are O
horrific B-OP
, O
bad B-OP
, O
vomit-inducing B-OP
, O
YUCK O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

The O
counter B-AS
service I-AS
is O
bad B-OP
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

They O
're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

NO O
PIZZA B-AS
33 I-AS
for O
me O
! O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet O
, O
where O
greasy O
, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary O
. O

The O
dosas B-AS
are O
skimpy B-OP
, O
unattractive B-OP
and O
drip B-OP
with I-OP
grease I-OP
, O
and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I O
'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

The O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
dry B-OP
, O
tasteless B-OP
and O
way O
overpriced B-OP
. O

Calling O
the O
place B-AS
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive B-OP
room B-AS
with O
unhelpful B-OP
clerks B-AS
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

Seriously O
, O
this O
place B-AS
kicks B-OP
ass I-OP
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
unheralded B-OP
, O
the O
service B-AS
impecible B-OP
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
magnificant B-OP
. O

Best B-OP
Italian B-AS
food I-AS
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely B-OP
, O
peaceful B-OP
place B-AS
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful B-OP
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it O
's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-AS
dishes I-AS
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
delicious B-OP
. O

This O
is O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

Love B-OP
Pizza O
33.. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave B-OP
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-AS
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-AS
spot I-AS
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising B-OP
. O

The O
pizza B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest B-OP
in O
NYC O
. O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
( O
a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants O
) O
. O

I O
've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a O
, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel O
! O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

The O
cream B-AS
cheeses I-AS
are O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
and O
I O
love B-OP
that O
coffee B-AS
! O
! O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast O
! O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
! O

Bagels B-AS
are O
ok B-OP
, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests O
! O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-AS
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-AS
! O
.. O

the O
turkey B-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
scary B-OP
! O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese O
food O
I O
've O
ever O
encountered O
. O

The O
soup B-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
udon I-AS
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water O
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
was O
awful B-OP
! O

The O
rice B-AS
was O
poor B-OP
quality I-OP
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly B-OP
it O
was O
hard B-OP
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-AS
had O
no O
seasoning O
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
and O
disgusting B-OP
. O

The O
fish B-AS
was O
adequate B-OP
, O
but O
inexpertly B-OP
sliced I-OP
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

Good B-OP
, O
fast B-OP
service B-AS
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
inexpensive B-OP
. O

The O
location B-AS
is O
perfect B-OP
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O
. O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican O
! O

Well O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny B-OP
. O

If O
you O
like B-OP
your O
music B-AS
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O

Winnie B-AS
and O
her O
staff B-AS
are O
the O
best B-OP
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
reliable B-OP
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

For O
authentic B-OP
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-AS

, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-AS
menu I-AS
... O
they O
're O
all O
delicious B-OP
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
was O
special B-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
attentive B-OP
, O
yet O
discreet B-OP
. O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle O
. O

The O
brioche B-AS
and I-AS
lollies I-AS
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute B-OP
and O
sweet B-OP
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal O
. O

I O
'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

The O
place B-AS
was O
quiet B-OP
and O
delightful B-OP
. O

Service B-AS
was O
good B-OP
and O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful B-OP
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-AS
and O
crab B-AS
salad I-AS
( O
they O
are O
all O
good B-OP
) O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good B-OP
spot B-AS
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster O
, O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B-AS
Strike I-AS
has O
been O
the O
best B-OP
laid-back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
pleasant B-OP
, O
fun B-OP
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous B-OP
( O
in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O

way O
, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b O

. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
yummy B-OP
, O
especially B-OP
their O
cooked-to-perfection B-OP
mussels B-AS
in I-AS
spicy I-AS
tomato I-AS
sauce I-AS
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-AS
. O

But O
the O
best B-OP
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-AS
night I-AS
atmosphere I-AS
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish B-OP

outrageously O
good B-OP
taste O
in O

takes O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong B-OP
with O
this O
place B-AS

Suan B-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Its O
location B-AS
is O
good B-OP
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable B-OP
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
LOVE B-OP
their O
Thai B-AS

noodles B-AS
with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
and I-AS
chicken I-AS
and I-AS
coconut I-AS
juice I-AS
is O
the O
MUST B-OP
! O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-AS
soon O
! O

In O
summer-eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-AS
( O
another O
great B-OP
feature O
of O
Suan O

! O
! O
! O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier B-OP
staff B-AS
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
better B-OP
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there O
. O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner O
location O
. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better B-OP
. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

The O
food B-AS
now O
is O
inconsistent B-OP
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
you O
'd O
like B-OP
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
casual B-OP
and O
romantic B-OP
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
! O

if O
you O
're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-AS
vinegar I-AS
over I-AS
icecream I-AS
, O
it O
's O
wonderful B-OP
! O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-AS
Go I-AS
Hamburgers I-AS
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
( O
$ O
8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns O
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
though O
pricey B-OP
by O
Chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

The O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long B-OP
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek B-OP
( O
for O
Chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip B-OP
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
egg B-AS
custards I-AS
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

( O
1 O
) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
Mott O
St. O
just O
south O
of O
bayard O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O
. O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional B-OP
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
shank I-AS
in I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
which O
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
friendly B-OP
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
casual B-OP
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy B-OP
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy B-OP
a O
great B-OP
meal B-AS

this O
little B-OP
place B-AS
has O
a O
cute B-OP
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

the O
pad B-AS
se I-AS
ew I-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
, O
however O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
was O
far O
too O
oily B-OP
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time O
. O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B-AS
House I-AS
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
's O
always O
good B-OP
. O

The O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
are O
GREAT B-OP
! O

Finally O
a O
reliable B-OP
Chinese B-AS
restaurant I-AS
! O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better B-OP
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management B-AS
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down O
. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

delicious B-OP
bagels B-AS
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

Spreads B-AS
and O
toppings B-AS
are O
great B-OP
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey B-OP
. O

Service B-AS
is O
fast B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
wo O
n't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O
. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it O
's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
decent B-OP
at I-OP
best I-OP
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet B-OP
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying B-OP
. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

Rao B-AS
is O
a O
good B-OP
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
's O
nothing B-OP
special I-OP
. O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

But O
after O
last O
night O
, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I O
'm O
eating O
indian B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-AS
appetizers I-AS
. O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
correct B-OP
ambience B-AS
and O
an O
excellent B-OP
staff B-AS
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
great B-OP

, O
great B-OP
service B-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good B-OP
quality I-OP
, O
cheap B-OP
eats B-AS
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

it O
's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amazing B-OP
indian B-AS
food I-AS
. O

I O
really O
loved B-OP
the O
different B-OP
and O
inovated O
touch O
that O
's O
the O
cheff B-AS
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

also O
it O
's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic B-OP
and O
comfortable B-OP
place B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
it O
's O
just O
perfect B-OP
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place B-AS
! O

I O
love O
Ess-a-bagel O
, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray O
's O
for O
convenience O
. O

Their O
bagels B-AS
are O
fine B-OP
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked B-OP
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel O
place O
. O

Great B-OP
bagels B-AS
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O
. O

The O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
( O
if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound O
) O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-AS
is O
slow B-OP
and O
they O
do O
n't O
toast O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
amazing B-OP
! O
! O

The O
baked B-AS
clams I-AS
octopus I-AS
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best B-OP
we O
've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

The O
lamb B-AS
was O
tender B-OP
so O
full B-OP
of I-OP
flavor I-OP
, O
the O
dessert B-AS
was O
divine B-OP
! O
! O

The O
waiter B-AS
was O
attentive B-OP
. O

The O
place B-AS
itself O
is O
beautiful B-OP
the O
bar B-AS
scene I-AS
seems O
to O
be O
happening B-OP
. O

Volare O

everyone O
gets O

the O
same O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B-AS
is O
this O
friendly B-OP
. O

The O
restaurant B-AS
has O
a O
Family O
feel O
, O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions B-AS
which O
are O
enormous B-OP
; O
the O
veal B-AS
alone O
could O
have O
single-handedly O
solved O
third O
world O
famine O
. O

The O
anti-pasta B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B-AS
mains I-AS
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive B-OP
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably B-OP
priced I-OP
meal B-AS
. O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off-set O
by O
the O
pour-your-own B-OP
measures B-AS
of I-AS
liquers I-AS
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O

... O

Fantastic B-OP
place B-AS

Cute O
and O

. O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O

What O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
! O

Not O
the O
typical B-OP
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-AS
. O

A O
cool B-OP
bar B-AS
with O
great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent B-OP
beer B-AS
. O

And O
even O
with O
it O
's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too O
! O

Loved O
it O
! O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

The O
shrimp B-AS
scampi I-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
and O
the O
antipasti B-AS
were O
plentiful B-OP
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
ca O
n't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful B-OP
than O
the O
food B-AS
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-AS
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-AS
do O
n't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

Cozy B-OP
romantic B-OP
atomosphere B-AS
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
very O
prompt B-OP
but O
slightly O
rushed B-OP
. O

Food B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Too O
bad B-OP
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

The O
porcini B-AS
mushroom I-AS
pasta I-AS
special I-AS
was O
tasteless B-OP
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-AS
tagliatelle I-AS
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment O
. O

But O
that O
was O
n't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu B-AS
that O
resembled O
nothing B-OP
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range O
. O

I O
really O
liked B-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
eater O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best B-OP
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-AS
ribs I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
also O
recommend B-OP
the O
rice B-AS
dishes I-AS
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-AS
rice I-AS
porridge I-AS
. O

It O
's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

It O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-AS
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress B-OP
someone O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great B-OP
food B-AS
at O
a O
great B-OP
price O
and O
do O
n't O
mind B-OP
the O
decor B-AS
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

Quick B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
service B-AS
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

It O
's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office O
, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart O
's O
. O

When O
you O
're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-AS
dining I-AS
room I-AS
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular B-OP
, O
hand-painted B-OP
high B-OP
ceiling B-AS
) O
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful B-OP
, O
tasty B-OP
and O
filling B-OP
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
professional B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic B-OP
patio B-AS
. O

Ahhh O
... O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great B-OP
. O

This O
little O
place B-AS
definitely O
exceeded B-OP
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-AS
for O
your O
money O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
fast B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
tasty B-OP
and O
they O
had O
the O
best B-OP
hot B-AS
sauce I-AS
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

They O
all O
know O
you O
. O

Good B-OP
food B-AS
. O

Good B-OP
drink B-AS
. O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-AS
like O
this O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven O
. O

Great B-OP
spot B-AS
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O
. O

Warm B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific B-OP
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
in O
the O
warmer O
months O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion O
of O
wines B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints O
. O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
were O
great B-OP
, O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better B-OP
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B-AS
casserole I-AS
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken O
, O
all O
dark O
meat O
and O
on O
the O
bone O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

i O
've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B-AS
was O
fine B-OP
, O
if O
not O
good B-OP
. O

stick B-OP
with O
the O
chicken B-AS
, O
beef B-AS
, O
and O
lamb B-AS
dishes I-AS
. O

i O
do O
n't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
ca O
n't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

service B-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations O
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

skip B-OP

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai O
, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
not O
fresh B-OP
, O
the O
sauces B-AS
were O
bland B-OP
and O
very O
oily B-OP
. O

It O
just O
was O
n't O
Thai O
. O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza O
( O
as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca O
) O
. O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed O
. O

Pizza B-AS
was O
a O
little O
soggy B-OP
. O

Ravioli B-AS
was O
good B-OP
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

Not O
enough B-OP
wines B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
glass I-AS
either O
. O

Service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
was O
excellent B-OP
... O
and O
I O
liked B-OP
the O
setting B-AS
/ O
atmosphere B-AS
a O
lot O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
just O
average B-OP
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

This O
place B-AS
is O
a O
great B-OP
bargain I-OP
. O

Authentic B-OP

is O
just O
as O
good B-OP
. O

bottles B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
are O
cheap B-OP
and O
good B-OP
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

The O
food B-AS
was O
actually O
aweful B-OP
. O

I O
'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

The O
mussles B-AS
were O
the O
fishiest B-OP
things O
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
, O
the O
goat B-AS
cheese I-AS
salad I-AS
was O
missing B-OP
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne B-AS
chicken I-AS
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting B-OP
. O

Nice B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant B-OP
and O
the O
desert B-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

Would O
n't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner O
! O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date O
spot O
for O
Williamsburg O
couples O
. O

The O
jukebox B-AS
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O

The O
food B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
, O
rich B-OP
pastas B-AS

The O

In O
an O

sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent B-OP
Thai B-AS
food I-AS
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
spots O
. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice B-OP
decor B-AS
, O
good B-OP
service B-AS
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
surprisingly O
excellent B-OP
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
HUGE B-OP
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
) O
for O
two O
people O
. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O

this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O

For O
those O
that O
go O

and O
do O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

Rao O

My O

I O
LOVE B-OP
this O
place B-AS

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight B-OP
, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-AS
seating I-AS
, O
perfect B-OP
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

Indoor B-AS
was O
very O
cozy B-OP
and O
cute B-OP
. O

The O
portion B-AS
sizes I-AS
here O
are O
huge B-OP
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-AS
is O
good B-OP
. O

While O
it O
's O
not O
Nobu O
, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

Staff B-AS
is O
very O
accomodating B-OP
. O

Excellent B-OP
dumplings B-AS

10-piece B-AS

was O
great B-OP
. O

But O
$ O
1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece O
? O
? O
? O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
wo O
n't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O

The O

is O
very O
simple B-OP
but O
comfortable B-OP

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
small B-OP
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
so O
good B-OP
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-AS
lasagna I-AS
which O
is O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
and O
the O
chocolate B-AS
bread I-AS

for O
dessert O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
there O
is O
very O
attentive B-OP
and O
down B-OP
to I-OP
earth I-OP
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O

The O

When O

in O

gave O
them O

to O
test O
their O
palets O
, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them O
. O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices O
. O

Great B-OP
food B-AS
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
does O
a O
great B-OP
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O
is O
... O
) O
. O

I O
fell B-OP
in I-OP
love I-OP

with I-AS
shrimp I-AS
dumplings I-AS
and I-AS
slices I-AS
of I-AS
BBQ I-AS

This O
dish B-AS
is O
my O
favorite B-OP
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O
. O

Try O
the O
congee B-AS
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow B-AS
Ley I-AS
Soh I-AS
, O
a O

affordable O

even O
the O
wine B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
glass I-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O

Consistently O
good B-OP
Japanese B-AS
Tapas I-AS
. O

Same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

Always O
good B-OP
drinks B-AS
and O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good B-OP
; O

Atmosphere B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
and O
relaxed B-OP
too O
... O

A O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks O
... O

Yakitori B-AS
bbq I-AS
meats I-AS
is O
tasty B-OP
too O
. O

It O
's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel O
's O
Share O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O
bar O
... O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we O
've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low B-OP
quality I-OP
fish B-AS
, O
unfriendly B-OP
staff B-AS
and O
a O
sushi B-AS
chef I-AS
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable B-OP
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-AS
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

Was O
n't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-AS
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O
. O

No O
thanks O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place B-AS
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens O
' O
biggest O
secret O
! O

Fabulous B-OP
decor B-AS
- O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
in O
a O
trendy O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
, O
very O
very O
good B-OP
food B-AS
, O
cheaply-priced B-OP
, O
generally O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
, O
and O
if O
you O
're O
a O
Manhattanite O
, O
or O
spend O
most O
of O
your O
time O
in O
Manhattan O
, O
Rice B-AS
Avenue I-AS
will O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
... O
..very O
Soho/Village/Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele O
... O
..all O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue O
! O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside O
. O

One O
would O
think O
we O
'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby B-OP
waiter B-AS
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced B-OP
food B-AS
, O
absurdly B-OP
arrogant I-OP
wait-staff B-AS
who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy B-OP
service B-AS
, O
and O
management B-AS
that O
does O
n't O
care O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed B-OP
with O
the O
service B-AS
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overated B-OP
and O
on O
the O
pricey B-OP
side O
. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

Great O
bagels O
, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in O
. O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
okay B-OP
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

They O
're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

Baluchi O
's O
has O
solid B-OP
food B-AS
and O
a O
nice B-OP
decor B-AS
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-AS
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent B-OP
. O

He O
offers O
subpar B-OP
service B-AS
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment O
. O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy B-OP
service B-AS
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good B-OP
nigiri B-AS
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

$ O
20 O
for O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
sushi I-AS
can O
not O
be O
beaten B-OP
. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-AS
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends O
, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable B-OP
hours O
there O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first O
, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-AS
are O
very O
attentive B-OP
, O
friendly B-OP
and O
quite O
attractive B-OP
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20's/30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

The O
vibe B-AS
is O
very O
relaxed B-OP
and O
cozy B-OP
, O
service B-AS
was O
great B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
! O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
and O
the O
view B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
new I-AS
york I-AS
city I-AS
skiline I-AS
was O
terrific B-OP
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand B-OP
requesting O
a O
table B-AS
by I-AS
the I-AS
window I-AS
. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-AS
was O
good B-OP
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing B-OP
to O
place B-AS
to O
eat O
. O

I O
've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

Personal B-AS
pans I-AS
are O
the O
perfect B-OP
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
. O

There O
is O
a O
downside B-OP
if O
you O
're O
ordering O
in O
-- O
the O
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic B-OP
delivery B-AS
guys I-AS
( O
a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O
b/c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup O
) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ai O
n't O
bad O
. O

the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
ca O

or O
undermine O
. O

The O
pasta B-AS
penne I-AS
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery B-OP
, O
creamy B-OP
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O

a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O

and O

and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good B-OP
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-AS
and O
the O
great B-OP
staff B-AS
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host B-AS
, O
Vittorio O
, O
and O
his O
crew B-AS
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family O
-- O
although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not-so-little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing B-OP
he O
's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not-so-frequent O
visitor O
. O

I O
've O
also O
been O
amazed B-OP
at O
all O
the O
new B-OP
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
: O
A O

Thin B-AS

, O
and O

a O
Lasagna B-AS

which O
is O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
( O

a O
disapointing B-OP
meal B-AS

We O

have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy B-OP
dumplings B-AS
from O

. O

Luckily B-OP
