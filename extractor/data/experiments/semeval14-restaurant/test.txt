The O
bread B-AS
is O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
as O
well O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
they O
have O
one O
of O
the O
fastest B-OP
delivery B-AS
times I-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

Food B-AS
is O
always O
fresh B-OP
and O
hot- O
ready O
to O
eat O
! O

Did O
I O
mention O
that O
the O
coffee B-AS
is O
OUTSTANDING B-OP
? O

Certainly O
not O
the O
best B-OP
sushi B-AS
in O
New O
York O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
always O
fresh B-OP
, O
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
very O
clean B-OP
, O
sterile B-OP
. O

I O
trust B-OP
the O
people B-AS
at O
Go O
Sushi O
, O
it O
never O
disappoints B-OP
. O

Straight-forward O
, O
no O
surprises O
, O
very O
decent B-OP
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
. O

BEST B-OP
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS

, O
great B-OP
asian B-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Try O
the O
rose B-AS
roll I-AS
( O
not O
on O
menu B-AS
) O
. O

I O
love B-OP
the O
drinks B-AS
, O
esp O
lychee B-AS
martini I-AS
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
also O
VERY O
good B-OP
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
was O
not O
a O
Nicoise B-AS
salad I-AS
and O
was O
barely B-OP
eatable I-OP
. O

While O
there O
's O
a O
decent B-OP
menu B-AS
, O
it O
should O
n't O
take O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
your O
drinks B-AS
and O
45 O
for O
a O
dessert B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

Once O
we O
sailed O
, O
the O
top-notch B-OP
food B-AS
and O
live B-AS
entertainment I-AS
sold O
us O
on O
a O
unforgettable B-OP
evening O
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
horrible B-OP
; O
so O
rude B-OP
and O
disinterested B-OP
. O

The O
sangria B-AS
's O
- O
watered O
down O
. O

menu B-AS
- O
uneventful B-OP
, O
small B-OP
. O

Anytime O
and O
everytime O
I O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Sushi O
Rose O
for O
fresh B-OP
sushi B-AS
and O
great B-OP
portions B-AS
all O
at O
a O
reasonable B-OP
price B-AS
. O

Great O
food B-AS
but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
dreadful B-OP
! O

The O
portions B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
food I-AS
that O
came O
out O
were O
mediocre B-OP
. O

the O
two O
waitress B-AS
's I-AS
looked O
like O
they O
had O
been O
sucking O
on O
lemons O
. O

From O
the O
beginning O
, O
we O
were O
met O
by O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
memebers I-AS
, O
and O
the O
convienent O
parking B-AS
at O
Chelsea O
Piers O
made O
it O
easy B-OP
for O
us O
to O
get O
to O
the O
boat O
. O

We O
enjoyed B-OP
ourselves O
thoroughly O
and O
will O
be O
going O
back O
for O
the O
desserts B-AS
... O
. O

Desserts B-AS
are O
almost O
incredible B-OP
: O
my O
personal O
favorite B-OP
is O
their O
Tart B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
Day I-AS
. O

I O
am O
surprised O
at O
the O
lower O
reviews O
because O
it O
is O
definitely O
better B-OP
than O
other O
places O
I O
have O
tried O
with O
higher O
ratings O
. O

Maybe O
the O
secret O
was O
that O
we O
went O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
and O
everything O
was O
great B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
extremely O
tasty B-OP
, O
creatively B-OP
presented I-OP
and O
the O
wine B-AS
excellent B-OP
. O

WE O
ENDED O
UP O
IN O
LITTLE O
ITALY O
IN O
LATE O
AFTERNOON O
. O

WE O
WERE O
PLEASANTLY B-OP
SURPRISED I-OP
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O
. O

THE O
LASAGNA B-AS
WAS O
PROBABLY O
THE O
BEST B-OP
I O
HAVE O
TASTED O
. O

Harumi O
Sushi O
has O
the O
freshest B-OP
and O
most B-OP
delicious I-OP
array B-AS
of I-AS
sushi I-AS
in O
NYC O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
it O
for O
not O
just O
its O
superb B-OP
cuisine B-AS
, O
but O
also O
for O
its O
friendly B-OP
owners B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
. O

If O
you O
're O
craving O
some O
serious B-OP
indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
desire O
a O
cozy B-OP
ambiance B-AS
, O
this O
is O
quite O
and O
exquisite B-OP
choice O
. O

I O
definitely O
enjoyed B-OP
the O
food B-AS
as O
well O
. O

have O
always O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time O
here O
. O

It O
was O
pleasantly B-OP
uncrowded I-OP
, O
the O

was O
delightful B-OP
, O
the O
garden B-AS
adorable B-OP
, O
the O
food B-AS
( O
from O
appetizers B-AS
to O
entrees B-AS
) O
was O
delectable B-OP
. O

You O
will O
be O
very O
happy B-OP
with O
the O
experience O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
surprisingly O
good B-OP
, O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
. O

How O
pretentious B-OP
and O
inappropriate B-OP
for O
MJ O
Grill O
to O
claim O
that O
it O
provides O
power O
lunch B-AS
and O
dinners B-AS
! O

Two O
wasted B-OP
steaks B-AS
-- O
what O
a O
crime O
! O

The O
staff B-AS
should O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly B-OP
. O

I O
absolutely O
suggest O
this O
place O
. O

I O
think O
the O
meatball B-AS
parm I-AS
is O
good B-OP
. O

If O
you O
want O
good B-OP
tasting I-OP
, O
well B-OP
seasoned I-OP
latin B-AS
food I-AS
eat O
at O
Cabana O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
. O

Definitely O
try O
the O
taglierini B-AS
with I-AS
truffles I-AS
- O
it O
was O
incredible B-OP
. O

Also O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
attentive B-OP
and O
really O
personable B-OP
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great B-OP
new O
restaurant O
that O
has O
been O
consistently O
good B-OP
every O
time O
I O
have O
been O
. O

The O
gnocchi B-AS
literally O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
! O

a O
great B-OP
experience O
at O
Trio O
... O

pleasant B-OP
; O
food B-AS
was O
tasty B-OP
and O
large B-OP
in O
portion B-AS
size I-AS
- O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
portobello/gorgonzola/sausage B-AS
appetizer I-AS
and O
the O
lobster B-AS
risotto I-AS
. O

Entrees B-AS
include O
classics O
like O
lasagna B-AS
, O
fettuccine B-AS
Alfredo I-AS
and O
chicken B-AS
parmigiana I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
the O
teriyaki B-AS
I O
recommend B-OP
. O

Meal B-AS
was O
very O
expensive B-OP
for O
what O
you O
get O
. O

Try O
the O
Peanut B-AS
Butter I-AS
Sorbet I-AS
and O
the O
pizza B-AS
with I-AS
soy I-AS
cheese I-AS
! O

Good B-OP
food B-AS
at O
the O
right B-OP
price B-AS
, O
what O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
. O

We O
love B-OP
it O
, O
and O
took O
buses O
and O
cabs O
to O
get O
there O
. O

If O
you O
' O
re O
in O
New O
York O
, O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
miss O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
attentive B-OP
, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

I O
've O
been O
coming O
here O
on O
and O
off O
for O
the O
past O
five O
years O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
La O
Lanterna O
has O
never O
, O
ever O
dissapointed O
me O
. O

Great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
great B-OP
waitstaff B-AS
, O
great B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
and O
best B-OP
of O
all O
GREAT B-OP
beer B-AS
! O

this O
is O
still O
one O
of O
my O
most O
favorite B-OP
restaurants O
in O
the O
area O
the O
food B-AS
is O
inexpensive B-OP
but O
very O
good B-OP
( O
kimono B-AS
shrimp I-AS
special I-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
) O
and O
has O
a O
great B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
moved O
to O
Nolita O
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
for O
as O
long O
as O
we O
have O
lived O
here O
, O
Peasant O
has O
been O
our O
favorite B-OP
! O

The O
whole O
experience O
was O
satisfying B-OP
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
worth B-OP
the O
visit O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
interesting B-OP
and O
quite O
reasonably B-OP
priced B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
and O
clearly O
fresh B-OP
ingredients B-AS
were O
used O
. O

This O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
n't O
cooked O
fresh B-OP
; O
it O
was O
obviously O
made O
before O
hand O
and O
then O
reheated O
. O

Appetizer B-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
here O
; O
you O
can O
make O
a O
great B-OP
( O
and O
inexpensive B-OP
) O
meal B-AS
out O
of O
them O
. O

The O
spicy B-AS
mussels I-AS
are O
a O
highlight B-OP
. O

Also O
get O
the O
Onion B-AS
Rings I-AS
-- O
best B-OP
we O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

Would O
not O
return O
for O
the O
amount O
we O
paid O
. O

However O
, O
being O
foodies O
, O
we O
were O
utterly B-OP
disappointed I-OP
with O
the O
food B-AS
. O

Huge O
portions B-AS
, O
great B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
service B-AS
, O
and O
pretty O
good B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

I O
was O
highly O
disappointed B-OP
by O
their O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
then O
to O
the O
manager B-AS
, O
but O
the O
intensity B-OP
of I-OP
rudeness I-OP
from O
them O
just O
went O
up O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
the O
milkshakes B-AS
are O
even O
better B-OP
! O

Stay O
away O
if O
you O
're O
claustrophobic O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
'hood O
, O
definitely O
stop O
in O
. O

the O
mushroom B-AS
barley I-AS
soup I-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
. O

On O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
, O
I O
checked O
out O
Arezzo O
with O
my O
wife O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
did O
as O
the O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
friendly B-OP
, O
courteous B-OP
and O
efficient B-OP
. O

Their O
duck B-AS
here O
is O
also O
absolutely O
delicious B-OP
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
come O
back O
to O
over O
the O
years O
. O

While O
it O
was O
large B-OP
and O
a O
bit O
noisy B-OP
, O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
fantastic B-OP
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
superb B-OP
. O

One O
caveat O
: O
Some O
of O
the O
curried B-AS
casseroles I-AS
can O
be O
a O
trifle O
harsh B-OP
. O

I O
was O
n't O
impressed B-OP
and O
it O
was O
n't O
SPICEY O
? O
? O
? O
? O

The O
food B-AS
was O
almost O
always O
EXCELLENT B-OP
. O

I O
was O
pleasently O
surprised O
at O
the O
taste B-AS
. O

A O
nice B-OP
space B-AS
, O
as O
long O
as O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
crowded O
and O
a O
singleminded O
devotion O
to O
its O
chosen O
cuisine B-AS
make O
Mare O
a O
great B-OP
choice O
for O
seafood B-AS
lovers O
. O

I O
never O
had O
an O
orange B-AS
donut I-AS
before O
so O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

they O
really O
provide O
a O
relaxing B-OP
, O
laid-back B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

This O
particular O
location O
certainly O
uses O
substandard O
meats B-AS
. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
resteraunt O
on O
my O
way O
home O
from O
the O
subway O
. O

The O
Management B-AS
was O
less B-OP
than I-OP
accomodating I-OP
. O

The O
ambience B-AS
is O
also O
more O
laid-back B-OP
and O
relaxed B-OP
. O

the O
teas B-AS
are O
great B-OP
and O
all O
the O
sweets B-AS
are O
homemade B-OP
. O

mojitos B-AS
and O
the O
service B-AS
are O
the O
best B-OP
part O
in O
there O

Sandwiches B-AS
, O
burgers B-AS
and O
salads B-AS
, O
like O
the O
lemon-dressed B-AS
cobb I-AS
, O
are O
classic B-OP
successes I-OP
. O

this O
restaurant O
is O
absolutely O
beautiful B-OP
. O

The O
design B-AS
is O
very O
intimate B-OP
and O
romantic B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
and O
imaginative B-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
very O
sharp B-OP
and O
they O
look O
good B-OP
too O
. O

The O
worst B-OP
though O
was O
the O
taste B-AS
. O

They O
were O
dry B-OP
, O
stale B-OP
and O
pretty O
flavorless B-OP
. O

The O
fajita B-AS
we O
tried O
was O
tasteless B-OP
and O
burned B-OP
and O
the O
mole B-AS
sauce I-AS
was O
way O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
. O

Stay O
with O
the O
roasted B-AS
chickens I-AS
and O
you O
'll O
be O
fine B-OP
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
warm B-OP
, O
comfortable B-OP
, O
artsy B-OP
and O
sexy B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
( O
big B-OP
selection B-AS
, O
reasonable B-OP
prices B-AS
) O
and O
the O
drinks B-AS
are O
really O
good B-OP
. O

The O
steak B-AS
melted O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

The O
food B-AS
did O
take O
a O
few O
extra O
minutes O
to O
come O
, O
but O
the O
cute B-OP
waiters B-AS
' O
jokes O
and O
friendliness O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
it O
is O
reasonably B-OP
priced B-AS
. O

The O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
( O
I O
'm O
not O
used O
to O
having O
much O
choice O
at O
restaurants O
) O
, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

Only O
suggestion O
is O
that O
you O
skip O
the O
dessert B-AS
, O
it O
was O
overpriced B-OP
and O
fell O
short B-OP
on O
taste B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
was O
decent B-OP
, O
but O
not O
great B-OP
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
this O
restaurant O
is O
so O
often O
overlooked O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
walk O
in O
, O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
in O
the O
perfect B-OP
place O
. O

i O
dont O
know O
what O
some O
people O
who O
rave O
about O
this O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS
are O
talking O
about O
. O

it O
is O
a O
hidden O
delight O
complete O
with O
a O
quaint B-OP
bar B-AS
and O
good B-OP
food B-AS
. O

I O
find O
that O
most O
Kosher O
restaurants O
are O
average O
to O
good O
, O
but O
this O
has O
been O
the O
best B-OP
I O
've O
eaten O
so O
far O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
ALWAYS O
look O
angry B-OP
and O
even O
ignore O
their O
high-tipping O
regulars O
. O

the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
very O
nice B-OP
, O
and O
a O
welcome B-OP
escape O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
SI O
mall O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
're O
a O
bit O
more B-OP
expensive I-OP
then I-OP
typical I-OP
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
so O
is O
their O
food B-AS
. O

Not O
terrible B-OP
, O
but O
not O
the O
restaurant O
in O
the O
reviews O
of O
2002 O
. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
wraps B-AS
, O
burgers B-AS
and O
salads B-AS
were O
all O
fresh B-OP
, O
tasty B-OP
and O
the O
mango B-AS
margareta I-AS
at O
$ O
9 O
was O
WELL B-OP
WORTH I-OP
the O
money O
. O

It O
was O
delicious B-OP
and O
large B-OP
! O

Anywhere O
else O
, O
the O
prices B-AS
would O
be O
3x O
as O
high O
! O

The O
service B-AS
we O
experienced O
was O
friendly B-OP
and O
good B-OP
. O

Our O
waiter B-AS
was O
friendly B-OP
and O
it O
is O
a O
shame O
that O
he O
didnt O
have O
a O
supportive B-OP
staff B-AS
to O
work O
with O
. O

The O
folding B-AS
chair I-AS
I O
was O
seated O
at O
was O
uncomfortable B-OP
. O

As O
we O
waited O
I O
watched O
3 O
seperate O
groups O
of O
diners O
discuss O
how O
dissapointed O
they O
also O
were O
. O

An O
excellent B-OP
choice O
in O
midtown O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
among O
the O
best B-OP
I O
have O
ever O
had O
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
fettucino B-AS
alfredo I-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP
and O
I O
was O

the O
food B-AS

The O
falafal B-AS
was O

dramatically O
lacking B-OP

The O

desserts B-AS
-- O
especially O
the O
silken O
creme B-AS
brulee I-AS
and O
paper-thin O
apple B-AS
tart I-AS
-- O
are O
good B-OP
enough O
on O
their O
own O
to O
make O
the O
restaurant O
worth B-OP
the O
trip O
. O

My O
friend O
told O
me O
about O

What O
a O
difference O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
very O
comforting B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
better B-OP
than I-OP

but O
what O
really O
standed O
out O
was O
such O
a O
dynamic B-OP
and O
extensive B-OP

Frankly O
, O
the O

We O
started O
with O
the O

also O
had O
the O

. O

Not O

, O
you O
'd O
expect O
it O

Food B-AS
portion I-AS

very O
comfy B-OP
and O
laid-back B-OP
, O
all O
the O
while O

. O

For O
a O
savory B-OP
take O
on O
the O

and I-AS
sandwich I-AS
meal I-AS
, O
try O
the O
hot B-AS

my O

food I-AS
is O

of I-OP
this I-OP

There O

scrumptious B-OP
, O
from O
the O
excellent B-OP

by O
cute B-OP
waitresses B-AS

to O
the O
extremely O
lush B-OP

. O

It O
's O
traditional B-OP
, O
simple B-OP
italian B-AS

. O

My O
girlfriend O

our O
10 O

Lou O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
all-around O
good B-OP
, O
with O
the O
rolls B-AS
usually O
excellent B-OP
and O
the O
sushi/sashimi B-AS
not O
quite O
on O
the O
same O
level O
. O

( O
The O
sashimi B-AS
is O
cut O
a O
little O
thinly B-OP
. O

Bay O
Terrace O
mall O
is O
nothing O
( O
ok O
, O
almost O
nothing O
) O
without O
it O
! O

Could O
have O
had O
better O
for O
1/3 O
the O

in O
Chinatown O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
had O
a O
blast O
. O

personally O
i O
say O

. O

In O
addition O
to O
great B-OP
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
, O
DOTP O
has O
wonderful B-OP
breakfast B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
that O
feature O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
great B-OP
things O
like O
tator B-AS
tots I-AS
and O
English B-AS
muffins I-AS
, O
a O
delicious B-OP
NJ-based O
pork B-AS
product I-AS
know O
to O
us O
Jersey O
girls O
and O
boys O
as O
Taylor B-AS
ham I-AS
. O

Believe O
me O
, O
they O
live O
up O
to O
the O
name O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
happened O
because O
of O
a O
graceless B-OP
manager B-AS
and O
a O
rude B-OP
bartender B-AS
who O
had O
us O
waiting B-AS
20 O
minutes O
for O
drinks B-AS
, O
and O
then O
tells O
us O
to O
chill O
out O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
service B-AS
great B-OP
, O
but O
forming O
conversation O
around O
a O
table O
is O
so O
easy B-OP
beacuse O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
can O
be O
both O
romantic B-OP
and O
comfortable B-OP
. O

When O
the O
dish B-AS
arrived O
it O
was O
blazing O
with O
green B-AS
chillis I-AS
, O
definitely O
not O
edible B-OP
by O
a O
human O
. O

The O
absolute O
worst B-OP
service B-AS
I O
've O
ever O
experienced O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
below B-OP
average I-OP
( O
when O
they O
actually O
gave O
people O
the O
meals B-AS
they O
ordered O
) O
. O

It O
's O
about O
$ O
7 O
for O
lunch B-AS
and O
they O
have O
take-out B-AS
or O
dine-in B-AS
. O

They O
are O
by O
far O
the O
BEST B-OP
past O
in O
New O
York O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
several O
times O
before O
attending O
an O
afternoon O
performance O
. O

Everything O
is O
very O
cheap B-OP
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
accompany O
your O
food B-AS
with O
one O
of O
their O
fresh B-AS
juice I-AS
concoctions I-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
reasonable B-OP
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
clean B-OP
, O
and O
if O
you O
like B-OP
soul B-AS
food I-AS
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
be O
! O

You O
'll O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
eating O
there O
after O
church O
. O

I O
had O
roast B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
a O
salad B-AS
. O

I O
've O
been O
a O
regular O
customer O
at O
Juice O
Generation O
for O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
- O
my O
office O
moved O
to O
the O
Film O
Center O
on O
Ninth O
Avenue O
and O
they O
are O
on O
the O
next O
block O
. O

They O
have O
a O
very O
good B-OP
chicken B-AS
with I-AS
avocado I-AS
and O
good B-OP
tuna B-AS
as O
well O
. O

It O
's O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
I O
like O
to O
support O
! O

But O
the O
meals B-AS
were O
terrible B-OP
. O

My O
chicken B-AS
was O
completely O
dried B-OP
out I-OP
and O
on O
the O
cold O
side O
and O
the O
sauce B-AS
was O
not O
very O
flavorful B-OP
. O

Malted B-AS
Milk I-AS
Ball I-AS
Gelato I-AS
- O
have O
you O
ever O
in O
your O
life O
heard O
of O
anything O
so O
ridiculously O
wonderful B-OP
? O

just O
walk O
by O
the O
window O
and O
see O
all O
the O
unbiased O
positive O
reviews O
in O
all O
the O
major O
nyc O
publications O
. O

Way O
too B-OP
much I-OP
money O
for O
such O
a O
terrible B-OP
meal B-AS
. O

Would O
not O
recommend B-OP
anyone O
to O
go O
. O

However O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
absolutely O
horrible B-OP
. O

A O
con O
was O
the O
slow B-OP
bar B-AS
service I-AS
. O

Dessert B-AS
was O
also O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
! O

BTW O
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
very O
good B-OP
. O

We O
loved B-OP
it O
and O
will O
go O
back O
! O

I O
came O
again O
weeks O
later O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
and O
again O
had O
a O
very O
nice B-OP
experience O
. O

It O
's O
eaten O
with O
black B-AS
vinegar I-AS
and O
shredded B-AS
ginger I-AS
. O

The O
unattractive B-OP
lighting B-AS
made O
me O
want O
to O
gag O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
overpriced B-OP
, O
there O
was O
the O
most O
awful B-OP
disco B-AS
pop I-AS
duo I-AS
performing-and O
my O
escargot B-AS
looked O
like O
it O
might O
crawl O
off O
the O
plate O
. O

We O
'll O
definitly O
be O
back O
again O
! O

This O
is O
the O
best B-OP
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
. O

it O
is O
a O
cozy B-OP
place B-AS
to O
go O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
friends O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
always O
great B-OP
, O
and O
the O
owner B-AS
walks O
around O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
enjoy O
. O

because O
the O
waiters B-AS
need O
SEVERE O
ATTITUE O
ADJUSTMENTS O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
shavue O
restaurants O
in O
LA O
, O
but O
few O
out O
here O
. O

Horrible B-OP
experience O
- O
stay O
away O
! O

If O
this O
restaurant O
was O
in O
Manhattan O
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
go O
more O
often O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
highly O
recommended B-OP
. O

When O
it O
came O
time O
to O
take O
the O
order O
the O
waiter B-AS
gave O
us O
a O
hard O
time O
, O
walked O
away O
then O
came O
back O
with O
a O
paper O
and O
pen O
for O
us O
to O
write O
down O
what O
we O
wanted O
... O
excuse O

but O

One O
of O

Fav O
spots O

Over B-OP
priced I-OP

Do O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant O

since O
i O
was O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
we O
made O
sure O
to O
give O
this O
a O
try O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
they O
are O
fantastic B-OP
. O

Dieters O
stick O
to O
salads B-AS
or O
indulge O
in O
vegetarian B-AS
platters I-AS
. O

So O
for O
a O
filling B-OP
and O
healthy B-OP
meal B-AS
give O
it O
a O
go O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
much O
worse O
it O
would O
have O
been O
if O
we O
'd O
gone O
at O
a O
prime O
time O
! O

I O
have O
dined O
at O
Mammino O
several O

and O
each O

Definitely O
something O

come O
down O
and O

out O
. O

Since O
I O
cook O
for O
a O
living O
, O
I O
'm O
very O
fussy B-OP
about O
the O
food B-AS
I O
eat O
in O
restaurants O
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
outstanding B-OP
. O

I O
went O
for O
restaurant O
week O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
stop O
here O
for O
pizza B-AS
before O
hitting O
the O
Kips O
Bay O
movie O
theater O
. O

We O
always O
enjoy B-OP
the O
pizza B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
pretty O
good B-OP
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
few O
friends O
and O
will O
return O
. O

This O
place O
has O
been O
around O
for O
a O
few O
years O
. O

Yum O
, O
the O
chicken B-AS
is O
great B-OP
here O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend B-OP
this O
restaurant O
! O
! O

You O
will O
find O
everything O
about O
Trio O
to O
your O
liking B-OP
! O

This O
place O
was O
the O
worst B-OP
. O

I O
ordered O
from O
here O
last O
week O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
's O
located O
on O
86 O
street O
, O
right O
underneath O
the O
train O
station O
. O

The O
food B-AS
here O
was O
great B-OP
, O
a O
treat O
from O
beginning O
to O
end O
. O

The O
host B-AS
( I-AS
owner I-AS
) I-AS
and O
servers B-AS
are O
personable B-OP
and O
caring B-OP
. O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
out O
this O
place O
after O
hearing O
about O
it O
in O
many O
magazines O
. O

It O
's O
just O
everything O
... O
the O
food B-AS
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
... O
the O
incrediby O
kind B-OP
and O
gracious B-OP
hostess B-AS
. O

Having O
moved O
I O
truly O
miss O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

I O
usually O
get O
one O
the O
Vietnamese B-AS
Beef I-AS
Noodle I-AS
Soup I-AS
. O

SUM O
IT O
: O
local O
investment O
bankers O
like O
it O
, O
try O
for O
yourself O
at O
least O
once O
. O

I O
started O
going O
to O
dosa O
hut O
more O
after O
that O
. O

We O
were O
wondering O
why O
they O
were O
there O
to O
make O
our O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
miserable B-OP
? O

Too O
bad B-OP
, O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best B-OP
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
in O
New O
York O
, O
hands O
down O
. O

The O
waiters B-AS
are O
very O
friendly B-OP
and O
helpful B-OP
and O
if O
you O
frequent O
they O
will O
remember O
you O
. O

Intimate O
but O
charming B-OP
interior B-AS
with O
extremely O
friendly B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
service B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
as O
creative B-OP
as O
the O
decor B-AS
and O
both O
worked O
. O

Siam O
Square O
is O
fairly O
new O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
I O
think O
in O
time O
will O
gain O
the O
recognition O
it O
deserves O
. O

My O
first O
experience O
at O
Siam O
Square O
was O
very O
pleasant B-OP
. O

I O
have O
gone O
back O
to O
Siam O
Square O
many O
times O
since O
and O
everytime O
I O
am O
very O
satisfied B-OP
overall O
. O

The O
menu B-AS
is O
great B-OP
, O
with O
a O
good B-OP
selection B-AS
, O
and O
everything O
that O
I O
have O
tried O
is O
absolutely O
delicious B-OP
. O

We O
had O
our O
Christmas O
party O
at O
Dos O
Caminos O
and O
it O
was O
wonderful B-OP
. O

My O
personal O
favorite B-OP
is O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
's O
. O

The O
sauce B-AS
is O
zesty B-OP
and O
flavorful B-OP
and O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
and O
crispy B-OP
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best B-OP
sushi B-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
an O
excellent B-OP
selection B-AS
( O
the O
rolls B-AS
with I-AS
crab I-AS
are O
really O
great B-OP
) O
. O

Everyone O
who O
works O
there O
( O
the O
host B-AS
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
, O
the O
servers B-AS
) O
is O
so O
helpful B-OP
. O

And O
the O
food B-AS
is O
fantastic B-OP
. O

Favourites B-OP
include O
: O
potato B-AS
spinach I-AS
gnocchi I-AS
and O
the O
lamb B-AS
. O

Another O
great B-OP
thing O
about O
Glechik-everything O
is O
very O
cheap B-OP
! O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
chose O
this O
spot O
for O
lunch B-AS
as O
we O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
and O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
South O
St O
Seaport O
. O

But O
regulars O
know O
that O
the O
sandwiches B-AS
are O
the O
real O
star B-OP
here O
. O

The O
skillfully O
chosen O
Portuguese B-AS
cheese I-AS
cart I-AS
paired O
with O
quality O
port B-AS
provides O
the O
perfect B-OP
Iberian O
ending O
. O

My O
friend O
had O
a O
burger B-AS
and O
I O
had O
these O
wonderful B-OP
blueberry B-AS
pancakes I-AS
. O

We O
were O
so O
happy B-OP
with O
our O
food B-AS
and O
were O
even O
more O
thrilled B-OP
when O
we O
saw O
the O
bill B-AS
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
come O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
place O
just O
is O
n't O
ready O
for O
prime O
time O
. O

All O
toppings B-AS
are O
so O
fresh B-OP
you O
'd O
think O
they O
had O
their O
own O
vegetable O
garden O
and O
the O
crust B-AS
is O
so O
perfect B-OP
, O
that O
one O
actually O
thinks O
of O
how O
it O
was O
made O
. O

Quartino O
is O
my O
favoriate B-OP
resturant O
in O
NYC O
. O

We O
've O
always O
gotten O
amazing B-OP
service B-AS
and O
we O
love B-OP
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
waitstaff B-AS
is O
solicitous B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
and O
always O
seems O
glad O
to O
see O
us O
, O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful B-OP
, O
if O
not O
stunningly O
creative O
. O

I O
'm O
in O
love B-OP
with O
the O
lobster B-AS
ravioli I-AS
! O

My O
order O
is O
on O
my O
table O
even O
on O
a O
busy O
friday O
night O
within O
10 O
minutes O
( O
at O
the O
most O
) O
of O
hanging O
up O
the O
phone O
. O

We O
came O
across O
this O
restaurant O
by O
accident O
while O
at O
a O
DUMBO O
art O
festival O
and O
thoroughly O
enjoyed B-OP
our O
meal B-AS
. O

Service B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
, O
no O
wait B-AS
, O
and O
you O
get O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
price B-AS
. O

I O
thought O
the O
food B-AS
is O
n't O
cheap B-OP
at O
all O
compared O
to O
Chinatown O
. O

And O
you O
never O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
you O
need O
to O
leave O
. O

Coffee B-AS
is O
a O
better B-OP
deal O
than O
overpriced B-OP
Cosi B-AS
sandwiches I-AS
. O

We O
did O
n't O
know O
if O
we O
should O
order O
a O
drink B-AS
or O
leave O
? O

great B-OP
neighbhorhood O
spot O
. O

Bobb O
V O
's O
is O
a O
great B-OP
place O
to O
take O
your O
Friends O
and O
Family O
! O

) O
It O
's O
not O
the O
best O
Japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
solid B-OP
one O
for O
its O
modest B-OP
prices B-AS
, O
and O
worth B-OP
repeat O
visits O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
so O
good B-OP
and O
so O
popular B-OP
that O
waiting B-AS
can O
really O
be O
a O
nightmare B-OP
. O

Here O
's O
the O
thing O
, O
you O
're O
in O
the O
best O
city O
in O
the O
world O
for O
restaurants O
. O

Go O
spend O
your O
money O
somewhere O
that O
really O
wows O
you O
. O

The O
crowd O
was O
older O
and O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
cramped B-OP
, O
but O
it O
has O
old O
school O
charm O
. O

This O
is O
a O
real O
gem O
of O
a O
place O
. O

I O
think O
this O
a O
a O
wonderful B-OP
place O
. O

First O
walking O
in O
the O
place B-AS
seemed O
to O
have O
great B-OP
ambience B-AS
. O

I O
went O
to O
Kitchenette O
this O
weekend O
for O
brunch B-AS
. O

This O
place O
does O
n't O
get O
the O
publicity O
that O
Sylvias O
Soul O
Food O
restaurant O
does O
, O
but O
it O
should O
. O

Just O
because O
P O
Diddy O
had O
a O
party O
at O
Butter O
does O
n't O
mean O
we O
should O
be O
automatically O
impressed O
. O

Even O
for O
two O
very O
hungry O
people O
there O
is O
plenty B-OP
of O
food B-AS
left O
to O
be O
taken O
home O
( O
it O
reheats O
really O
well O
also O
) O
. O

Like O
I O
said O
, O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
's O
may O
not O
be O
everyone O
's O
favorite B-OP
, O
but O
it O
's O
mine O
. O

The O
help O
was O
extremely O
nice B-OP
and O
did O
not O
rush O
us O
. O

Then O
they O
somehow O
made O
a O
dry B-OP
and O
burnt B-OP
crust B-AS
, O
around O
a O
raw O
and O
cold O
inside O
. O

It O
's O
just O
good B-OP
food B-AS
, O
nothing O
more O
and O
that O
's O
all O
we O
want O
! O

DO O
N'T O
KNOW O
WHAT O
THE O
OTHERS O
ON O
THE O
BLOCK O
WERE O
LIKE O
BUT O
WE O
WERE O
PLEASED B-OP
WITH O
OUR O
CHOICE O
. O

Average O
cake B-AS
thats O
been O
courted O
by O
a O
LOT O
of O
hype O
. O

It O
's O
cute B-OP
and O
simple B-OP
and O
I O
loved B-OP
it O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
recently O
visited O
the O
bistro O
for O
dinner B-AS
and O
had O
a O
wonderful B-OP
experience O
. O

. O

Everytime O

I O
ca O
n't O
pick O

Even O
after O
a O

bad O
evenings O
at O
Bardolino O
, O
I O
keep O
coming O

The O
pizza B-AS

sure O

Chef B-AS
Waldy O

always O
measures O
up O
. O

This O
diamond O
in O
the O

is O
definitely O
worth B-OP
my O
10-minute O
walk O
from O
the O
6 O
train O
. O

Being O
a O
vegan O
myself O
, O
I O
've O
made O
a O
point O
of O
trying O
all O
the O
vegan O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
-- O
and O
Zen O
Palate O
is O
easily O
my O
favorite B-OP

Don O
Pedro O

the O
apetizers B-AS

good B-OP
and O
the O
Sangria B-AS

very O
good B-OP
. O

Cantinetta O
is O
a O
real O
treasure O
in O
a O
see O
of O
mediocre O
Italian O
restaurants O
. O

The O
one O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
service B-AS
was O
prompt B-OP
, O
we O
got O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
the O
server B-AS
was O
very O
friendly B-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
greeted O
me O
warmly B-OP
at O
the O
door O
and O
I O
was O
seated O
promptly B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

Whether O
one O
pizza O
place O
is O
better O
than O
another O
is O
often O
very O
subjective O
. O

Really O
nice B-OP
restaurant O
to O
go O
with O
a O
group O
or O
on O
a O
date O
. O

Service B-AS
is O
usually O
pretty O
good B-OP
. O

Host B-AS
and O
Hostess B-AS
was O
quite O
rude B-OP
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
missing O
anything O
. O

I O
discovered O
Applebees O
when O
I O
went O
away O
to O
college O
in O
VA O
. O

the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
is O
very O
friendly B-OP
, O
if O
your O
not O
rude O
or O
picky O
... O
... O
.our O
meal B-AS
at O

. O

I O
recommend B-OP
any O

their O
salmon B-AS
dishes I-AS
... O
... O

The O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
was O
sweet B-OP
and O
luscious B-OP
. O

The O
menu B-AS
, O
which O
changes O
seasonally O
, O
shows O
both O
regional O
and O
international O
influences O
. O

but O
their O
mac B-AS
cheese I-AS
was O
YUMMY B-OP
! O

their O
brunch B-AS
menu I-AS
had O
something O
for O
everyone O
. O

jazz B-AS
singer I-AS
had O
a O
nice B-OP
voice O
+ O
she O
made O
us O
all O
get O
up O
to O
dance O
to O
shake O
some O
cals O
to O
eat O
some O
more O
. O

I O
often O
find O
myself O
with O
time O
to O
kill O
in O
Times O
Square O
, O
which O
is O
a O
shame O
since O
I O
do O
n't O
love O
this O
area O
. O

They O
have O
very O
quick B-OP
service B-AS
which O
is O
great B-OP
when O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
much O
time O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
average B-OP
: O
breakfast B-AS
food I-AS
, O
soups B-AS
, O
salads B-AS
, O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
etc O
. O

I O
WAS O
HIGHLY O
DISAPPOINTED B-OP
BY O
THE O
FOOD B-AS
. O

THE O
BANANA B-AS
PUDDING I-AS
THEY O
SERVE O
HAS O
NEVER O
SEEN O
AN O
OVEN O
, O
THE O
CRABCAKES B-AS
ARE O
WAY O
OVER B-OP
SALTED I-OP
AND O
DO O
N'T O
GET O
ME O
STARTED O
ON O
THE O
VERY O
GREASY B-OP
MAC B-AS
AND I-AS
CHEESE I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
arrogant B-OP
, O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
way O
high B-OP
for O
Brooklyn O
. O

This O
place O
is O
average B-OP
... O
at O
best O
. O

the O
service B-AS
is O
prompt B-OP
friendly B-OP
. O

Whatever O
the O
reason O
it O
is O
definitely O
the O
place O
to O
be O
. O

This O
is O
literally O
a O
hot B-OP
spot I-OP
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
food B-AS
. O

The O
downstairs B-AS
bar I-AS
scene I-AS
is O
very O
cool B-OP
and O
chill B-OP
... O

The O
food B-AS
was O
definitely O
good B-OP
, O
but O
when O
all O
was O
said O
and O
done O
, O
I O
just O
could O
n't O
justify O
it O
for O
the O
price B-AS
( O
including O
2 O
drinks B-AS
, O
$ O
100/person O
) O
... O

I O
've O
come O
here O
for O
casual B-AS
lunches I-AS
as O
well O
as O
for O
a O
friend O
's O
birthday O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy B-OP
myself O
. O

If O
you O
are O
a O
Tequila B-AS
fan O
you O
will O
not O
be O
disappointed B-OP
. O

Great B-OP
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
too O
, O
something O
like O
50 O
beers B-AS
. O

After O
reading O
the O
great O
reviews O
, O
I O
invited O
a O
die-hard O
downtown O
friend O
of O
mine O
to O
join O
me O
at O
TASTE O
. O

Not O
to O
sound O
too O
negative O
but O
be O
wary B-OP
of O
the O
delivary B-AS
. O

Feels O
like O
family O
when O
we O
go O
there O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
just O
as O
good B-OP
as O
its O
owner B-AS
, O
Da O
Silvano O
, O
just O
much B-OP
less I-OP
expensive I-OP
. O

They O
have O
homemade B-AS
pastas I-AS
of O
all O
kinds O
-- O
I O
recommend B-OP
the O
gnocchi B-AS
-- O
yum B-OP
! O

My O
vegetable B-AS
risotto I-AS
was O
burnt B-OP
, O
and O
infused O
totally O
in O
a O
burnt B-OP
flavor B-AS
. O

What O
a O
pleasant B-OP
surprise O
! O

The O
main O
draw O
of O
this O
place O
is O
the O
price B-AS
. O

How O
can O
hope O
to O
stay O
in O
business O
with O
service B-AS
like O
this O
? O

But O
dinner B-AS
here O
is O
never O
disappointing B-OP
, O
even O
if O
the O
prices B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
over B-OP
the I-OP
top I-OP
. O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
have O
amazing B-OP
, O
sandwiches B-AS
, O
soup B-AS
, O
pizza B-AS
etc O
, O
but O
their O
homemade B-AS
sorbets I-AS
are O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
! O

the O
homemade B-AS
Guacamole I-AS
, O
the O
unbelievable B-OP
entree B-AS
, O
and O
thee O
most O
amazing B-OP
deserts B-AS
. O

The O
sushi B-AS
is O
reasonably B-OP
priced B-AS
and O
fresh B-OP
. O

It O
's O
no-fuss B-OP
, O
fast B-OP
and O
delicious B-OP
. O

Save O
room O
for O
deserts B-AS
- O
they O
're O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
. O

Best O
things O
to O
order O
are O
from O
the O
grill B-AS
( O
Churrasco B-AS
and O
Ribs B-AS
) O
. O

The O
traditional B-AS
Italian I-AS
items I-AS
are O
great B-OP
- O
cheap B-OP
and O
served B-AS
in O
a O
cozy B-OP
setting B-AS
. O

Whether O
your O
choose O
the O
iced B-AS
blended I-AS
mocha I-AS
or O
the O
hot B-AS
white I-AS
mocha I-AS
you O
are O
sure O
to O
be O
extremely O
happy B-OP
. O

last O
Tuesday O
for O
a O
late B-AS
lunch I-AS
with O
a O
friend O
. O

It O
was O
delish B-OP
and O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
bad B-OP
eating O
it O
. O

Another O
friend O
had O
to O
ask O
3 O
times O
for O
parmesan B-AS
cheese I-AS
. O

Our O
waitress B-AS
had O
apparently O
never O
tried O
any O
of O
the O
food B-AS
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
one O
to O
recommend O
any O
wine B-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow B-OP
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
a O
bit O
small B-OP
so O
if O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

No O
doubt O
the O
next O
time O
we O
want O
to O
go O
out O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
or O
are O
entertaining O
guests O
from O
out O
of O
town O
, O
Spirit O
and O
Bateaux O
will O
be O
our O
destination O
. O

i O
would O
recommend B-OP
Jewel O
Bako O
if O
you O
want O
to O
feel O
like O
you O
were O
kicked O
in O
the O
groin O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
too O
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
was O
pretty O
cool B-OP
, O
but O
not O
worth B-OP
the O
hassle O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
lady O
next O
to O
us O
thought O
she O
had O
ordered O
a O
salad B-AS
( O
including O
asking O
for O
salad B-AS
dressing I-AS
) O
and O
was O
instead O
given O
a O
quesedilla B-AS
. O

El O
Nidos O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
which O
I O
've O
ever O
been O
to O
, O
has O
a O
great B-OP
variety O
of O
tasty B-OP
, O
mouth B-OP
watering I-OP
pizza B-AS
's I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
pretty O
poor B-OP
all O
around O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
well O
below B-OP
average I-OP
relative O
to O
the O
cost B-AS
, O
and O
outside O
there O
is O
a O
crazy O
bum O
who O
harasses O
every O
customer O
who O
leaves O
the O
place O
. O

Although O
I O
moved O
uptown O
I O
try O
to O
stop O
in O
as O
often O
as O
possible O
for O
the O
GREAT B-OP
cheap B-OP
food B-AS
and O
to O
pay O
the O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
a O
visit O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
friend O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
for O
a O
few O
minutes O

Chef B-AS
Vincenzo O
, O
always O
there O
if O
you O
need O
him O
, O
is O
a O
real O
talent O
and O
a O
real O
Roman O
. O

If O
you O
're O
looking O
to O
taste O
some O
great B-OP
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
and O
want O
good B-OP
service B-AS
, O
definitely O
visit O
Curry O
Leaf O
. O

You O
must O
try O
Odessa B-AS
stew I-AS
or O
Rabbit B-AS
stew I-AS
; O
salads-all O
good B-OP
; O
and O
kompot B-AS
is O
soo O
refreshing B-OP
during O
the O
hot O
summer O
day O
( O
they O
make O
it O
the O
way O
my O
mom O
does O
, O
reminds O
me O
of O
home O
a O
lot O
) O
. O

My O
daughter O
and O
I O
left O
feeling O
satisfied B-OP
( O
not O
stuffed O
) O
and O
it O
felt O
good B-OP
to O
know O
we O
had O
a O
healthy B-OP
lunch B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
almost O
tempted O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
bad O
review O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
the O
crowds O
away O
... O
been O
going O
there O
on O
and O
off O
for O
a O
year O
now O
and O
it O
's O
really O
my O
fave O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
city O
. O

When O
she O
complained O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
Sorry O
. O

The O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
meat I-AS
was O
on B-OP
par I-OP
with O
your O
local O
grocery O
store O
. O

They O
specialize O
in O
smoothies B-AS
and O
fresh B-AS
juices I-AS
. O

It O
first O
came O
well O
done O
, O
and O
I O
politely O
sent O
it O
back O
. O

I O
recommend B-OP
the O
black B-AS
roasted I-AS
codfish I-AS
, O
it O
was O
the O
best B-OP
dish B-AS
of O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
manager B-AS
then O
told O
us O
we O
could O
order O
from O
whatever O
menu B-AS
we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O
we O
were O
so O
annoyed B-OP
with O
the O
waiter B-AS
and O
the O
resturant O
that O
we O
let O
and O
went O
some O
place O
else O
. O

In O
mi O
burrito O
, O
here O
was O
nothing O
but O
dark B-OP
chicken B-AS
that O
had O
that O
cooked O
last O
week O
and O
just O
warmed O
up O
in O
a O
microwave B-OP
taste B-AS
. O

during O
busy O
hrs O
, O
i O
recommend B-OP
that O
you O
make O
a O
reservation B-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
waste O
your O
time O
or O
your O
money O
. O

it O
's O
good B-OP
but O
, O
like O
the O
movie O
is O
never O
as O
good B-OP
as O
the O
book O
, O
this O
is O
same O
analogy O
. O

it O
was O
a O
very O
warm B-OP
experience O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Common O
Stock O
for O
brunch B-AS
and O
I O
was O
so O
impressed B-OP
. O

now O
called O
nikki O
sushi B-AS
, O
sushi B-AS
is O
OK O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
also O
outstanding B-OP
and O
is O
served B-AS
quite O
quickly B-OP
. O

I O
just O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place O
that O
is O
negative O
except O
that O
it O
's O
not O
a O
cheap B-OP
night O
out O
... O
but O
it O
's O
SO O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

From O
the O
erbazzone B-AS
emiliana I-AS
to O
the O
mostarda B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
cheese I-AS
plate I-AS
, O
the O
dishes B-AS
at O
this O
restaurant O
are O
all O
handled O
with O
delicate B-OP
care O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
bar B-AS
has O
a O
great B-OP
vibe B-AS
. O

expectations O
were O
real O
hi O
reading O
the O
'10 O
's O
' O
. O

There O
's O
candlelight B-AS
and O
music B-AS
. O

It O
's O
nice B-OP
to O
find O
a O
place O
that O
is O
open O
24 O
hours O
( O
especially O
in O
downtown O
Brooklyn O
) O
. O

Simple B-OP
healthy B-OP
unglamorous B-OP
food B-AS
cheap B-OP
. O

It O
was O
such O
a O
fantastic B-OP
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
, O
that O
I O
returned O
again O
the O
same O
week O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
the O
food B-AS
still O
is O
good B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
quick B-OP
and O
attentative B-OP
even O
though O
its O
usually O
very O
busy B-OP
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
absolutely O
adorable B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
Chicken B-AS
Teriyaki I-AS
and O
my O
husband O
got O
Garlic B-AS
Shrimp I-AS
. O

I O
've O
had O
better B-OP
Japanese B-AS
food I-AS
at O
a O
mall O
food O
court O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
members I-AS
are O
extremely O
friendly B-OP
and O
even O
replaced O
my O
drink B-AS
once O
when O
I O
dropped O
it O
outside O
. O

Cool B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
but O
such O
a O
let O
down O
. O

The O
Sashimi B-AS
portion I-AS
are O
big B-OP
enough O
to O
appease O
most O
people O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
fact O
they O
used O
artifical B-AS
lobster I-AS
meat I-AS
. O

They O
have O
wheat B-AS
crusted I-AS
pizza I-AS
made O
with O
really O
fresh B-OP
and O
yummy B-OP
ingredients B-AS
. O

Had O
a O
lovely B-OP
dinner B-AS
in O
this O
dedicated B-OP
seafood O
joint O
, O
food B-AS
was O
well-prepared B-OP
and O
-presented O
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
pleasant B-OP
and O
prompt B-OP
. O

the O
icing O
MADE O
this O
cake B-AS
, O
it O
was O
fluffy B-OP
, O
not O
ultra B-OP
sweet I-OP
, O
creamy B-OP
and O
light B-OP
. O

Finally O
let O
into O
the O
store O
5 O
at O
a O
time O
, O
to O
buy O
expensive B-OP
slices B-AS
from O
a O
harried B-OP
staff B-AS
. O

We O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
just O
leave O
because O
we O
were O
essentially O
being O
ignored B-OP
by O
the O
wait B-AS
staff I-AS
-- O
even O
though O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
largely O
empty O
. O

The O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
extensive B-OP
, O
well B-OP
priced B-AS
and O
covers O
alot O
of O
regions O
. O

Go O
here O
if O
you O
want O
fresh B-OP
and O
tasty B-OP
salads B-AS
of O
any O
type O
you O
can O
imagine O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
place O
is O
adorable B-OP
- O
even O
the O
bathroom B-AS
! O

Speedy B-OP
delivers B-AS
, O
great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
decent B-OP
prices B-AS
, O
and O
friendly B-OP
service B-AS
combine O
to O
ensure O
an O
enjoyable B-OP
repast B-AS
. O

THEY O
HAVE O
WAITERS B-AS
ON O
THE O
SIDEWALK O
TRYING O
TO O
PULL O
YOU O
IN O
WHICH O
MADE O
US O
SUSPICIOUS O
. O

IT O
WAS O
OUR O
ONLY O
OPPORTUNITY O
TO O
VISIT O
AND O
WANTED O
AN O
AUTHENTIC B-OP
ITALIAN B-AS
MEAL I-AS
. O

It O
took O
100 O
years O
for O
Parisi O
to O
get O
around O
to O
making O
pizza B-AS
( O
at O
least O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
ever O
made O
it O
before O
this O
year O
) O
... O
but O
it O
was O
worth B-OP
the O
wait O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
simple O
medium O
rare O
steak B-AS
. O

Generously B-OP
garnished I-OP
, O
organic B-AS
grilled I-AS
burgers I-AS
are O
the O
most O
popular B-OP
dish B-AS
, O
but O
the O
Jerusalem B-AS
market-style I-AS
falafel I-AS
wraps I-AS
and O
Mediterranean B-AS
salads I-AS
-- I-AS
layered I-AS
with I-AS
beets I-AS
, I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
and I-AS
walnuts I-AS
-- O
are O
equally B-OP
scrumptious I-OP
. O

Probably O
my O
worst B-OP
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
in O
new O
york O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
a O
former O
waiter B-AS
so O
I O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
talking O
about O
. O

Result O
( O
red O
velvet O
) O
: O
Great B-OP
texture B-AS
, O
soft B-OP
and O
velvety B-OP
, O
nice B-OP
hint B-AS
of I-AS
cocoa I-AS
. O

Ask O
for O
the O
round B-AS
corner I-AS
table I-AS
next I-AS
to I-AS
the I-AS
large I-AS
window I-AS
. O

Their O
twist B-AS
on I-AS
pizza I-AS
is O
heatlhy O
, O
but O
full B-OP
of I-OP
flavor I-OP
. O

The O
lack B-OP
of O
AC B-AS
and O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
a O
million O
swarming O
bodies O
( O
although O
everyone O
is O
polite O
and O
no O
one O
is O
pushing O
) O
is O
a O
slight O
turn O
off O
. O

I O
love B-OP
the O
Little O
Pie O
Company O
as O
much O
as O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
written O
reviews O
, O
but O
must O
discourage O
anyone O
from O
visiting O
the O
Grand O
Central O
location O
due O
to O
their O
RUDE B-OP
service B-AS
from O
two O
sales B-AS
people I-AS
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
unless O
you O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
it O
's O
not O
in O
a O
convenient B-OP
location B-AS
but O
is O
more O
like O
a O
hidden O
treasure O
. O

Did O
n't O
seem O
like O
any O
effort O

the O

quality I-AS

the I-AS
food I-AS

The O
food B-AS
-- O
though O
mostly O
deep-fried O
-- O
is O
simple B-OP
and O
satisfying B-OP
. O

We O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
have O
been O
going O
there O
twice O
a O
week O
since O
the O
day O
they O
first O
opened O
. O

Glechik O
might O
be O
way O
too B-OP
tiny I-OP
for O
a O
restaurant O
by O
Russian O
standards O
, O
but O
it O
is O
cozy B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
simply O
GREAT B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
- O
authentic B-OP
Italian B-AS

absolutely O
fresh B-OP

At O
night O
the O
atmoshere B-AS

The O
other O

be O
treated O
like O
a O
VIP O
in O
a O
not-crowded O
place B-AS
, O
with O
great B-OP
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
. O

I O
would O
only O
go O
for O
the O
coffee B-AS
which O
is O
way O
better B-OP
than O
Starbucks O
or O
the O
like O
. O

I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
regular O
costumer O
at O
pongal O
until O
dosa O
hut O
opened O
right O
next O
door O
to O
it O
. O

Somewhat O
disappointing B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
( O
only O
new O
vintages B-AS

Both O
were O
very O
good B-OP
, O
but O
nothing O
you O
could O
n't O
get O
at O
similar O

If O
your O

new B-AS

I O
can O
understand O
the O

if O
it O
served O
better O
food B-AS
, O
like O
some O
Chinese O
restaurants O
in O
midtown/uptown O
area O
. O

Service B-AS
was O
awful B-OP
- O
mostly O
because O
staff B-AS
were O
overwhelmed B-OP
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

To O
the O

good B-OP
job O

this O

is O
a O
keeper O

and O
the O
owner B-AS

simply O
lovely B-OP

This O

wonderfully B-OP

perfect B-OP

Has O
the O

of O
a O
family O
local O
yet O
it O
is O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
watch O
sporting O

The O
service B-AS
was O
great B-OP
, O
and O
they O
have O
a O
whole O
great B-OP
deal O
for O
birthdays O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
100 O
% O
Italian O
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
as O
authentic B-OP
as O
it O
gets O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
might O
be O
the O
fortune B-AS
cookies I-AS
- O
I O
've O
never O
had O
a O
cookie B-AS
predict O
bad O
luck O
for O
me O
before O
I O
visited O
Kar O
. O

Good B-OP
for O
a O
quick B-OP
sushi B-AS
lunch I-AS
. O

Have O
a O
mojito B-AS
and O
sit O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
dreadfully B-OP
slow I-OP
( O
the O
place O
was O
only O
half O
full O
) O
and O
a O
smile O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
... O

I O
went O
this O
past O
Saturday O
and O
had O
a O
excellent B-OP
meal B-AS
of O
consisting O
of O
a O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
shank I-AS
with I-AS
mashed I-AS
potatoes I-AS
. O

The O
waitress B-AS
came O
by O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
soy B-AS
sauce I-AS
WHILE O
we O
were O
eating O
our O
lunch B-AS
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

So O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
bar B-AS
, O
the O
bartender B-AS
did O
n't O
seem O
like O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
there O
. O

I O
reccomend B-OP
the O
fried B-AS
pork I-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
the O
orange B-AS
chicken/beef I-AS
, O
and O
the O
fried B-AS
rice I-AS
. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
dissapointed B-OP
by O
any O
of O
the O
choices O
in O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

The O
french B-AS
fries I-AS
-- I-AS
with I-AS
the I-AS
kalmata I-AS
dip I-AS
were O
terrific B-OP
! O

Would O
you O
ever O
believe O
that O
when O
you O
complain O
about O
over O
an O
hour O
wait B-AS
, O
when O
they O
tell O
you O
it O
will O
be O
20-30 O
minutes O
, O
the O
manager B-AS
tells O
the O
bartender B-AS
to O
spill O
the O
drinks B-AS
you O
just O
paid O
for O
? O

The O
boutique B-AS
selection I-AS
of I-AS
wines I-AS
covers O
a O
wide B-OP
variety O
without O
being O
imposeing O
. O

If O
you O
're O
lucky O
and O
there O
's O
not O
a O
private O
party O
going O
on O
back O
there O
, O
you O
'll O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
chill O
out O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
great B-OP
assortment B-AS
of I-AS
wraps I-AS
if O
your O
not O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
traditional B-AS
Mediterranean I-AS
fare I-AS
. O

Fresh B-AS
veggies I-AS

... O
soooo O
much O
fooood B-AS
, O
and O
all O
of O
it O
delicious B-OP
. O

Disappointingly B-OP
, O
their O
wonderful B-OP
Saketini B-AS
has O
been O
taken O
off O
the O
bar B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

In O
Short O
The O
Black O
Sheep O
distinguishes O
itself O
from O
the O
Midtown O
pub O
herd O
with O
a O
look B-AS
that O
's O
a O
mix O
of O
sports-bar O
butch O
and O
ornate O
kitsch O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
go O
back O
-- O
if O
only O
for O
some O
of O
those O
exotic B-OP
martinis B-AS
on O
the O
blackboard O
. O

They O
are O
located O
off O
the O
beaten O
path O
but O
are O
certainly O
worth B-OP
the O
trip O
. O

then O
she O
made O
a O
fuss O
about O
not O
being O
able O
to O
add O
1 O
or O
2 O
chairs B-AS
on O
either O
end O
of O
the O
table B-AS
for O
additional O
people O
. O

The O
happy B-AS
hour I-AS
is O
so O
cheap B-OP
, O
but O
that O
does O
not O
reflect O
the O
service B-AS
or O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

After O
waiting B-AS
for O
almost O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
brusquely O
told O
us O
he O
'd O
forgotten O
to O
give O
the O
kitchen B-AS
our O
order O
. O

With O
all O
the O
mundane O
or O
mediocre O
places O
on O
8th O
avenue O
it O
is O
nice B-OP
to O
have O
one O
that O
is O
a O
step O
above B-OP
in O
quaility B-AS
and O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

A O
mix O
of O
students O
and O
area O
residents O
crowd O
into O
this O
narrow O
, O
barely O
there O
space B-AS
for O
its O
quick B-OP
, O
tasty B-OP
treats B-AS
at O
dirt-cheap B-OP
prices B-AS
. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
, O
menu B-AS
is O
typical O
French O
but O
varied B-OP
. O

It O
gets O
crowded B-OP
at O
lunchtime O
but O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
seats B-AS
in O
back O
and O
everyone O
who O
works O
there O
is O
so O
nice B-OP
. O

but O
for O
the O
value B-AS
, O
it O
was O
a O
great B-OP
affordable B-OP
spot O
to O
enjoy B-OP
a O
fun B-OP
night O
out O
with O
small O
group O
. O

the O
negative O
reviews O
on O
city O
search O
are O
probably O
from O
jealous O
competing O
restaurants O
who O
realize O
they O
ca O
n't O
compete O
with O
Temple O
's O
entire O
positive B-OP
attitude B-AS
about O
the O
proper O
way O
to O
treat O
their O
customers O
and O
deliver O
top B-OP
quality I-OP
food B-AS
. O

We O
ordered O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
and O
were O
finished O
eating O
and O
paying O
before O
the O
wine O
came O
. O

It O
was O
good B-OP
, O
but O
none O
of O
the O
flavors B-AS
WOW O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
place B-AS
to O
take O
a O
few O
friends O
to O
hang O
out O
at O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
quality O
for O
a O
good B-OP
restaurant O

Actually O
, O
everyone O
who O
worked O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
annoyed B-OP
. O

for O
about O
eleven O
bucks O
you O
get O
a O
gigantic O
burrito B-AS
( O
or O
tacos B-AS
) O
, O
margarita B-AS
, O
and O
dessert B-AS
. O

The O
space B-AS
is O
traditional B-OP
in O
feel O
. O

the O
restaurant O
was O
completely O
empty O
, O
but O
she O
gave O
me O
a O
dirty O
look O
and O
asked O
, O
no O
reservations B-AS
? O

the O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre B-OP
to O
be O
kind O
- O
the O
interior B-AS
is O
small B-OP
and O
average B-OP
- O
the O
owners B-AS
are O
a O
tag-team O
of O
unpleasantries O
- O
so O
rude B-OP
and O
snotty B-OP
i O
actually O
let O
out O
a O
hearty O
guffaw O
whilst O
dining B-AS

Good O

I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
this O
restaurant O
for O
years O
, O
in O
the O
past O
the O
service B-AS
was O
average B-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
inconsistant B-OP
. O

The O
music B-AS
was O
fascinating B-OP
, O
but O
left O
room O
for O
conversation O
, O
and O
the O
bartender B-AS
made O
superb B-OP
drinks B-AS
. O

rice B-AS

you O

I O

and O
all O
I O

marginally B-OP
so-so I-OP

in O
a O

that O
was O
just O
so O
freezing B-OP
we O

i O
went O

for O
a O

and O
was O
greeted O

a O
very O

It O

to O
take O
a O
cab O
to O
Chelsea O
just O
for O
an O
awesome B-OP
dinner B-AS
at O
My O
Chelsea O
. O

Not O

the O

practically O
off-the-boat B-OP

This O

has O
the O

the O

tries O
too O
hard O
to O
make O
fancy B-OP

The O

are O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
slow B-OP
. O

the O
food B-AS
- O
not O
worth B-OP
the O

What O
can O
you O
say O
about O
a O
place O
where O
the O
waitress B-AS
brings O
out O
the O
wrong B-OP
entree B-AS
, O
then O
verbally O
assaults O
your O
80 O
year O
old O
grandmother O
and O
gives O
her O
lip O
about O
sending O
it O
back O
( O
which O
she O
did O
politely O
, O
by O
the O
way O
) O

The O
halibut B-AS
cheek I-AS
appetizer I-AS
came O
with O
a O
generous B-OP
portion B-AS
of I-AS
foie I-AS
gras I-AS
, O
but O
that O
's O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
meal B-AS
. O

Food B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
and O
they O
also O
have O
empenadas B-AS
and O
plaintains B-AS
which O
are O
good B-OP
for O
an O
afternoon B-AS
snack I-AS
. O

Both O
a O
number O
of O
the O
appetizer B-AS
and O
pasta B-AS
specials I-AS
were O
amazing B-OP
. O

All-time O

lighter O
options O
like O

also O
available O

Although O
somewhat O
loud B-OP
, O
the O
noise B-AS
was O
minimally B-OP
intrusive I-OP
. O

It O
's O
a O
basic O
pizza B-AS
joint O
, O
not O
much O
to O
look O
at O
, O
but O
the O
pizza B-AS
is O
what O
I O
go O
for O
. O

Tables B-AS
are O
close B-OP
, O
so O
you O
better O
be O
comfortable O
bumping O
elbows O
with O
other O
patrons O
. O

Not O
too O
much O
so O
, O
but O
enough O
that O
there O
's O
a O
great B-OP
scene B-AS
. O

You O
feel O
like O
you O
made O
it O
to O
New O
York O
when O
you O
eat O
here O
. O

We O
'd O
walked O
by O

times O

finally O
settled O
on O
a O

to O
enjoy O

We O

a O
distinctive B-OP
blend O
of O
chickpeas B-AS
, O
carrots B-AS
and O
other O
vegetables B-AS
and O
spices B-AS
. O

At O
peak O
times O
, O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overcrowded B-OP
and O
tables B-AS
are O
uncomfortably B-OP
close I-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
on O
point O
- O
what O
else O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
Ritz O
? O

Menus B-AS
feature O
seasonal O
picks O
, O
like O
sweet B-AS
corn-foie I-AS

from O
the O
simple O
Carinthia B-AS

mushrooms I-AS
to O
the O
caviar-topped B-AS

beautifully O
matched O
with O
a O
bright O

wimpy O

There O
restaurant O
is O
very O
casual B-OP
, O
but O
perfect B-OP
for O
lunch B-AS
, O
and O
their O
delivery B-AS
service I-AS
is O
always O
very O
fast B-OP

Chinatown O

The O
pastas B-AS
were O
pretty O
good B-OP

Atmosphere B-AS

The O

what O

Service B-AS
was O
good B-OP
and O
so O
was O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

MY O
date O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Branzini B-AS
and O
both O
felt O
the O
fish B-AS
was O
very O
average B-OP
. O

We O
were O
there O
March O
7 O
and O
found O
Maison O
very O
nice B-OP

The O

and O
an O
excellent B-OP
host B-AS
. O

went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
my O
coworker O
. O

Pizzas B-AS
were O
excellent B-OP
in O
addition O
to O
appetizers B-AS
and O
main B-AS
courses I-AS
. O

Definitely O
try O
the O
calamari B-AS
, O
any O
pasta B-AS
, O
or O
even O
the O
Sliced B-AS
steak I-AS
entree I-AS
. O

The O
caeser B-AS
salad I-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

The O
fried B-AS
calamari I-AS
was O
even O
better B-OP
! O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
dark B-OP
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
overall O
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
outstanding B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
tops B-OP
. O

The O
portions B-AS
are O
very O
large B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
fantastic B-OP
! O
! O

I O
recomend O
the O
chicken B-AS
milanese I-AS
. O

excellent B-OP
tapas B-AS
at O
great B-OP
prices B-AS
, O
romantic B-OP
, O
small B-OP
but O
not O
overly B-OP
crowed I-OP
, O
excellent B-OP

The O
service B-AS
is O
a O
quite O
slow B-OP
, O
but O
friendly B-OP
. O

The O
chocolate B-AS
raspberry I-AS
cake I-AS
is O
heavenly- O
not O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
, O
but O
full B-OP
of I-OP

. O

Our O

charming B-OP
, O
the O
food B-AS

perfect B-OP
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
HAD O
A O
BAD B-OP

( O
OR O
BAD B-OP

) O
@ O
PIGALLE O
. O

Best B-OP
hot B-AS

in O
the O
tri-state O
area O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
example O
of O
an O
establishment O
in O
which O
its O
owners O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
restaurant O
business O
! O

I O
would O
not O
recommend B-OP
MEET O
at O
all O
, O
it O
is O
a O
rip O
off O
all O
the O
way O
from O
the O
time O
to O
step O
in O
! O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
special O
celebration O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
quiet B-OP
and O
intimate B-OP
. O

The O
service B-AS
was O
very O
attentive B-OP
and O
very O
generous B-OP
. O

We O
had O
tons O
of O
great B-OP
food B-AS
, O
wine B-AS
, O
and O
desserts B-AS
. O

Really O
Lovely O
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
in O
the O
midst O
of O
buzzing O
midtown O
area O
. O

OK O
, O
I O
've O
been O
to O
Dumont O
a O
few O
times O
now O
. O

The O
food B-AS
really O
is O
n't O
very O
good B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
terrible B-OP
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
that O
most O
of O
Dumont O
's O
patrons O
are O
younger O
and O
have O
lower O
expectations O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
recommend B-OP
Dumont O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
they O
have O
the O
best B-OP
escargot B-AS
in O
town O
, O
they O
always O
try O
to O
accomodate O
our O
toddler O
. O

I O
've O
been O
to O
Sotto O
Voce O
several O
time O
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
this O
one O
place O
that O
hits O
the O
nail O
right O
on O
the O
head O
ever O
time O
! O

Between O
my O
guest O
and O
I O
, O
we O
sampled O
at O
least O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
menu B-AS
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
hits O
. O

The O
Deco B-AS
and O
ambiance B-AS
was O
really O
romantic B-OP
. O

This O
is O
the O
best B-OP
unknown O
restaurant O
in O
and O
around O
New O
York O
. O

Just O
go O
in O
and O
sample O
the O
greatest B-OP

For O
someone O
who O
used O
to O
hate O
Indian B-AS
food I-AS
, O
Baluchi O

has O
changed O
my O
mid O

Finally O
a O

I O
can O
eat O

enjoy B-OP
and O
not O
suffer O

only O
was O
the O

but O
also O
extremely O
helpful B-OP
. O

It O
took O
a O
bigger O
bite O
from O
my O
wallet O
than O
my O
appetite O
- O
I O
would O
not O
reccomend B-OP
this O
to O
anyone O
that O
I O
would O
want O
to O

This O

the O

The O

are O
my O
favorites B-OP
! O

Sushi B-AS
so O
fresh B-OP
that O
it O
crunches O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

But O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
enough O
room O
on O
your O
credit O
card O
as O
the O
bill B-AS
will O
leave O
a O
big O
dent O
in O
your O
wallet O
. O

Despite O
the O
5th O
ave O
address O
there O
are O
no O
frills O
whick O
I O
also O
love O
. O

They O
bring O
a O
sauce B-AS
cart I-AS
up O
to O
your O
table B-AS
and O
offer O
you O
up O
to O
7 O
or O
8 O
choices B-AS
of I-AS
sauces I-AS
for O
your O
steak B-AS
( O
I O
tried O
them O
ALL O
) O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
sushi B-AS
fresh B-OP
, O
they O
also O
served O
other O
entrees B-AS
allowed O
each O
guest O
something O
to O
choose O
from O
and O
we O
all O
left O
happy B-OP
( O
try O
the O
duck B-AS
! O

good B-OP
variety B-AS
but O
nothing B-OP
surprising I-OP
. O

After O
I O
paid O
for O
my O
purchase O
, O
I O
noticed O
they O
had O
not O
given O
me O
utensils B-AS
so O
I O
could O
eat O
my O
pie B-AS
. O

Likewise O
if O
you O
like O
really O
thin B-AS
crust I-AS
or O
really O
big O
slices B-AS
then O
Nick O
and O
Joe O
's O
may O
not O
be O
your O
favorite O
. O

It O
's O
always O
quiet O
because O
it O
's O
awful B-OP
. O

No O
green B-AS
beans I-AS
, O
no O
egg B-AS
, O
no O
anchovy B-AS
dressing I-AS
, O
no O
nicoise B-AS
olives I-AS
, O
no O
red B-AS
onion I-AS
. O

Build O
a O
meal B-AS
with O
side B-AS
orders I-AS
like O
Amazin B-AS
' I-AS
Greens I-AS
salads I-AS
, O
Buffalo B-AS
Chicken I-AS
Kickers I-AS
and O
Cinna B-AS
Stix I-AS
. O

Thick O
fries B-AS
, O
meaty B-AS
chili I-AS
and O
stuffed B-AS
baked I-AS
potatoes I-AS
round O
out O
a O
menu B-AS
that O
includes O
a O
cool B-OP
, O
ultra-thick B-OP
chocolate B-AS
Frosty I-AS
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
asking O
the O
waiter B-AS
to O
make O
something O
bland O
and O
different O
than O
what O
is O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

Good B-OP
cake B-AS
BUT O
: O
it O
was O
not O
the O
best B-OP
cake B-AS
i O
've O
ever O
had O
, O
and O
definately O
not O
worth B-OP
standing O
outside O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
being O
herded O
like O
cattle O
by O
indifferent B-OP
and O
overworked B-OP
employees B-AS
. O

The O
closest O
that O
I O
got O
was O
the O
Cherry B-AS
Marscapone I-AS
, O
but O
they O
were O
out O
of O
it O
that O
day O
. O

The O
homage O
to O
India O
is O
most O
evident B-OP
in O
the O
delectable B-OP
roti B-AS
canai I-AS
appetizer I-AS
, O
a O
fried B-AS
pancake I-AS
served I-AS
with I-AS
pungent I-AS
curry I-AS
dipping I-AS
sauce I-AS
, O
while O
the O
mango B-AS
chicken I-AS
offers O
a O
surprisingly B-OP
sophisticated I-OP
, O
fresh B-OP
take O
on O
sweet-and-sour O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
look O
like O
much O
on O
the O
outside B-AS
, O
but O
the O
minute O
you O
walk O
inside O
, O
it O
's O
a O
whole O
other O
atmosphere B-AS
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
the O
place O
was O
awesome B-OP
. O

The O
ground B-AS
chickpea I-AS
soup I-AS
we O
sampled O
as O
a O
starter B-AS
tasted O
somewhat O
thin B-OP
. O

We O
requested O
they O
re-slice O
the O
sushi B-AS
, O
and O
it O
was O
returned O
to O
us O
in O
small O
cheese-like O
cubes O
. O

The O
service B-AS
, O
however O
, O
is O
a O
peg O
or O
two O
below B-OP
the O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
( O
horrible B-OP
bartenders B-AS
) O
, O
and O
the O
clientele B-AS
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
are O
rowdy B-OP
, O
loud-mouthed B-OP
commuters O
( O
this O
could O
explain O
the O
bad B-OP
attitudes O
from O
the O
staff B-AS
) O
getting O
loaded O
for O
an O
AC/DC O
concert O
or O
a O
Knicks O
game O
. O

If O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
definitely O
stop O
by O
for O
a O
great B-OP
meal B-AS
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
with O
our O
show O
tickets O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
time O
to O
sample O
any O
desserts B-AS
. O

The O
restaurant O
could O
use O
a O
little O
paint O
, O
but O
all O
in O
all O
a O
great B-OP
sushi O
place O
! O

Make O
more O
tables- O
perhaps O
a O
rooftop B-AS
bar I-AS
? O

The O

Had O
dinner B-AS
here O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

We O
recently O
spent O
New O
Year O
's O
Eve O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
had O
a O
great B-OP
experience O
, O
from O
the O
wine B-AS
to O
the O
dessert B-AS
menu I-AS
. O

Highly O
recommended B-OP
... O
As O
stated O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
dined O
*in* O
the O
restaurant O
but O
stopped O
by O
there O
to O
pick O
up O
takeout B-AS
and O
it O
seems O
a O
very O
relaxing B-OP
place B-AS
; O
also O
, O
the O
bar B-AS
looks O
nice B-OP
. O

The O
ambiance B-AS
was O
fine B-OP
, O
a O
little O
loud B-OP
but O
still O
nice B-OP
and O
romantic B-OP
. O

but O
, O
the O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
was O
not O
very O
good B-OP
at O
all O
cocktail B-AS
hour I-AS
includes O
free B-OP
appetizers B-AS
( O
nice B-OP
non-sushi B-AS
selection I-AS
) O
. O

It O
took O
about O
2 O
1/2 O
hours O
to O
be O
served B-AS
our O
2 O
courses B-AS
. O

Who O
said O
go O
when O
the O
place B-AS
is O
quiet O
during O
the O
day O
? O

Can O
be O
a O
bit O
busy B-OP
around O
peak O
times O
because O
of O
the O
size B-AS
. O

I O
was O
on O
jury O
duty O
, O
rode O
my O
bike O
up O
Centre O
Street O
on O
my O
lunch O
break O
and O
came O
across O
this O
great B-OP
little O
place B-AS
with O
awesome B-OP
chicken B-AS
tacos I-AS
and O
Hibiscus B-AS
lemonade I-AS
. O

good B-OP
place B-AS
to O
hang O
out O
during O
the O
day O
after O
shopping O
or O
to O
grab O
a O
simple B-OP
soup B-AS
or O
classic B-OP
french B-AS
dish I-AS
over O
a O
glass B-AS
of I-AS
wine I-AS
. O

Very O
nice B-OP
touch O
that O
very O
much O
fits O
the O
place B-AS
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
just O
something O
so O
great B-OP
about O
being O
outdoors B-AS
, O
in O
great B-OP
landscaping O
, O
enjoying B-OP
a O
casual B-AS
drink I-AS
that O
makes O
going O
to O
this O
place B-AS
worthwhile B-OP
. O

We O
were O
seated O
promptly B-OP
in O
close O
proximity O
to O
the O
dance B-AS
floor I-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
here O
as O
a O
pre-show B-AS
meal I-AS
, O
hop O
in O
a O
cab O
and O
take O
the O
extra O
10 O
minutes O
to O
go O
to O
the O
uptown O
location O
. O

A O
plus O
was O
the O
good B-OP
mix O
of O
people O
in O
their O
twenties O
that O
provided O
for O
great B-OP
eye-candy O
while O
I O
was O
there O
. O

The O
comments O
about O
fried B-AS
foods I-AS
is O
correct O
( O
below O
) O
but O
the O
other O
dishes B-AS
, O
including O
the O
lamb B-AS
entree I-AS
and O
many O
of O
the O
salads B-AS
( I-AS
avocado I-AS
shrimp I-AS
) I-AS
were O
quite O
good B-OP
. O

It O
's O
best O
to O
go O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
with O
a O
close O
friend O
or O
a O
good O
book O
. O

Slow B-OP
service B-AS
, O
but O
when O
you O
're O
hanging O
around O
with O
groups O
of O
10 O
or O
20 O
, O
who O
really O
notices O
? O

The O
sauce B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
( O
very O
fresh B-OP
) O
with O
dabs B-AS
of I-AS
real I-AS
mozzarella I-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
ever O
bother O
- O
the O
drinks B-AS
were O
awful B-OP
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
that O
really O
made O
this O
the O
worst B-OP
experience O
at O
dining B-AS
. O

The O
room B-AS
is O
a O
little O
plain B-OP
, O
but O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
make O
such O
a O
small O
place B-AS
exciting O
and O
I O
would O
not O
suggest O
that O
as O
a O
reason O
not O
to O
go O
. O

Prices B-AS
even O
outside O
of O
restaurant O
week O
were O
great B-OP
. O

A O
small O
, O
outdoor B-AS
eating I-AS
area I-AS
makes O
for O
a O
private B-OP
, O
comfortable B-OP
space B-AS
to O
study O
alone O
or O
meet O
up O
with O
friends O
. O

Before O
the O
place O
did O
n't O
call O
my O
attention O
. O

And O
all O
the O
[ B-AS
female I-AS
] I-AS
servers I-AS
are O
cute B-OP
too O
, O
which O
is O
always O
nice B-OP
. O

The O
best B-OP
dessert B-AS
, O
a O
chocolate B-AS
and I-AS
peanut I-AS
butter I-AS
tart I-AS
, O
is O
n't O
particularly O
Hawaiian O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
small O
world O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
sweets B-AS
. O

for O
an O
appetizer B-AS
, O
their O
calamari B-AS
is O
a O
winner B-OP
. O

Satay O
is O
one O
of O
those O
favorite B-OP
haunts O
on O
Washington O
where O
the O
service B-AS
and O
food B-AS
is O
always O
on O
the O
money O
. O

After O
dinner B-AS
I O
heard O
music B-AS
playing O
and O
discovered O
that O
there O
is O
a O
lounge B-AS
downstairs O
. O

But O
now O
that O
it O
's O
under O
new O
ownership O
and O
has O
been O
renovated O
, O
it O
looks O
great B-OP
. O

The O
room B-AS
is O
a O
gorgeous B-OP
, O
bi-level B-AS
space I-AS
and O
the O
long B-AS
bar I-AS
perfect B-OP
for O
a O
drink B-AS
. O

Now O
we O
moved O
out O
of O
the O
state O
and O
every O
visit O
to O
NYC O
includes O
a O
stop O
here O
. O

Two O
complaints- O
their O
appetizer B-AS
selection I-AS
stinks B-OP
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice B-OP
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella B-AS
sticks I-AS
on O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
; O
nothing O
was O
memorable O
. O

It O
is O
bland B-OP
and O
nothing O
extrodinary O
. O

I O
was O
especially O
impressed B-OP
during O
the O
bday O
party O
when O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
in O
helping O
me O
decorate O
and O
bring O
out O
a O
bday O
cake O
as O
well O
as O
offering O
prompt B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
service B-AS
to O
a O
15 O
person O
party O
. O

The O
chicken B-AS
and I-AS
falafel I-AS
platters I-AS
were O
nondescript B-OP
combinations O
with O
fresh B-AS
leaf I-AS
salad I-AS
. O

Every O
time O
I O
visit O
NYC O
, O
I O
come O
here O
. O

I O
've O
been O
coming O
here O
regularly O
since O
it O
opened O
, O
about O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
takes O
you O
to O
that O
place O
, O
the O
place O
many O
dream O
of O
. O

several O
times O
and O
put O
up O
with O
the O
waiters B-AS
' O
bad B-OP
manners O
, O
knowing O
that O
their O
job O
is O
n't O
easy O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
great B-OP
( O
maybe O
even O
borderline O
nagging O
but O
at O
least O
you O
get O
attention O
) O
, O
the O
desserts B-AS
are O
excellent B-OP
and O
the O
coffee B-AS
is O
so O
very O
good B-OP
... O

We O
were O
seated O
next O
to O
a O
couple O
whose O
kitchen O
was O
being O
renovated O
and O
we O
agreed O
since O
we O
're O
all O
foodies O
who O
eat O
out O
a O
lot O
- O
that O
this O
was O
n't O
a O
place O
we O
'd O
return O
to O
. O

They O
are O
served B-AS
on O
Focacchia B-AS
bread I-AS
and O
are O
to O
die B-OP
for I-OP
. O

While O
the O
smoothies B-AS
are O
a O
little O
big B-OP
for O
me O
, O
the O
fresh B-AS
juices I-AS
are O
the O
best B-OP
I O
have O
ever O
had O
! O

The O
food B-AS
is O
just O
OKAY B-OP
, O
and O
it O
's O
almost O
not O
worth B-OP
going O
unless O
you O
're O
getting O
the O
pialla B-AS
, O
which O
is O
the O
only O
dish B-AS
that O
's O
really O
good B-OP
. O

The O
guac B-AS
is O
fresh B-OP
, O
yet O
lacking B-OP
flavor B-AS
, O
we O
like O
to O
add O
our O
fresh B-AS
salsa I-AS
into O
it O
. O

The O
new B-AS
menu I-AS
has O
a O
few O
creative B-OP
items O
, O
they O
were O
smart O
enough O
to O
keep O
some O
of O
the O
old O
favorites O
( O
but O
they O
raised O
the O
prices B-AS
) O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
I O
must O
agree O
with O
the O
person O
that O
wrote O
about O
their O
favorite O
words O
: O
No O
, O
ca O
n't O
, O
sorry O
... O
, O
boy O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
bend O
the O
rules O
for O
anyone O
. O

It O
' O
only O
open O
for O
lunch B-AS
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
so O
good B-OP
! O

If O
you O
like B-OP
seafood B-AS
and/or O
Greek B-AS
food I-AS
you O
will O
love B-OP
this O
place O
though O
it O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
just O
these O
things O
. O

`` O
The O
menu B-AS
includes O
pub B-AS
fare I-AS
-- O
burgers B-AS
, O
steaks B-AS
and O
shepherds B-AS
pie I-AS
-- O
and O
even O
a O
portabella B-AS
lasagna I-AS
for O
those O
black O
sheep O
known O
as O
`` O
vegetarians O
. O

How O
can O
they O
survive O
serving O
mediocre B-OP
food B-AS
at O
exorbitant B-OP
prices B-AS
? O
! O

The O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre B-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
was O
severely B-OP
slow I-OP
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
on O
a O
different O
occasion O
- O
the O
food B-AS
is O
mediocre B-OP
for O
the O
prices B-AS
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
back O
soon O
and O
eventually O
trying O
most O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
! O

I O
just O
had O
my O
first O
visit O
to O
this O
place O
and O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
and O
slowly O
work O
my O
way O
through O
the O
menu B-AS
. O

I O
asked O
repeatedly O
what O
the O
status O
of O
the O
meal B-AS
was O
and O
was O
pretty O
much O
grunted O
at O
by O
the O
unbelievably O
rude B-OP
waiter B-AS
. O

I O
stopped O
by O
for O
some O
brunch B-AS
today O
and O
had O
the O
vegan B-AS
cranberry I-AS
pancakes I-AS
and O
some O
rice B-AS
milk I-AS
. O

Weekends O
can O
get O
crowded B-OP
, O
but O
still O
highly O
recommended B-OP
. O

It O
gets O
very O
crowded B-OP
so O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
you O
get O
their O
early O
. O

Sweet B-OP
Irish O
bartender B-AS
is O
always O
happy O
and O
able O
to O
bring O
a O
smile O
to O
my O
friends O
a O
my O
face O
. O

I O
always O
find O
myself O
sitting O
next O
to O
someone O
in O
the O
theatre O
industry- O
interesting O
to O
hear O
ideas O
hashed O
out O
while O
having O
a O
quick O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

Its O
good B-OP
to O
go O
there O
for O
drinks B-AS
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
drunk O
because O
you O
'll O
be O
lucky O
if O
you O
can O
get O
one O
drink B-AS
an O
hour O
the O
service B-AS
is O
so O
bad B-OP
. O

Anyway O
, O
the O
owner B-AS
was O
fake B-OP
. O

Owner B-AS
is O
pleasant B-OP
and O
entertaining B-OP
. O

I O
have O
never O
in O
my O
life O
sent O
back O
food B-AS
before O
, O
but O
I O
simply O
had O
to O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
argued O
with O
me O
over O
this O
. O

Although O
the O
restaurant O
itself O
is O
nice B-OP
, O
I O
prefer O
not O
to O
go O
for O
the O
food B-AS
