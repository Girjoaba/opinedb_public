It O
s O
also O
ideal B-OP
for I-OP
many O
organized O
runs B-AS
and I-AS
walks I-AS
during O
the O
year O
. O

The O
sad O
part O
is O
, O
knowing O
this O
to O
be O
a O
famous B-OP
tourist B-AS
attraction I-AS
, O
I O
wish O
there O
was O
better O
stand O
for O
tourists O
to O
get O
off O
and O
take O
pictures O
. O

Truly B-OP
magnificent I-OP
views B-AS
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
arrive O
30-45 O
minutes O
early O
, O
as O
you O
can O
hang O
out O
in O
the O
lounge O
and O
get O
some O
up-close O
personal O
magic O
while O
enjoying B-OP
a O
drink B-AS
. O

Adjacent O
on O
one O
side O
is O
a O
grove O
of O
Eucalyptus O
trees O
with O
a O
utility O
road O
that O
leads O
to O
the O
Seacliff O
neighborhood O
s O
melange O
of O
should O
we O
say O
creative B-OP
expressions B-AS
of O
houses O
, O
and O
below O
there O
is O
a O
swimmable B-OP
beach B-AS
. O

I O
usually O
always O
come O
here O
during O
fleet O
week O
, O
you O
get O
a O
good B-OP
view B-AS
of O
the O
blue O
angels O
show O
. O

It O
s O
pretty B-OP
cool I-OP
to B-AS
see I-AS
, O
but O
what O
blows O
my O
mind O
is O
that O
people O
really O
do O
live O
on O
this O
street O
. O

I O
love B-OP
that O
the O
full B-AS
menu I-AS
is O
at O
the O
bar O
. O

It O
is O
worth B-OP
the O
drive B-AS
to O
see O
it O
. O

This O
park O
is O
appropriately O
named O
. O

And O
lets O
not B-OP
forget I-OP
the O
views B-AS
from I-AS
this I-AS
Park I-AS
! O
! O
! O

It O
was O
very O
sweet O
. O

We O
could O
even O
get O
off O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
crooked B-OP
street B-AS
part O
and O
take O
some O
pics O
with O
it O
on O
the O
background O
. O

It O
has O
from O
the O
Avengers O
, O
Felix O
the O
cat O
, O
Popeye O
, O
Disney O
, O
Simpsons O
and O
Mad O
. O

The O
fog O
softens B-OP
the O
light B-AS
even O
more O
and O
covers O
the O
trees O
with O
it O
s O
fine O
, O
lace O
like O
mist O
. O

It O
has O
panoramic B-OP
views B-AS
that O
are O
picture-perfect B-OP
almost O
anytime O
of O
year O
. O

It O
is O
a O
3/4 O
scale O
very O
close O
adaptation O
of O
the O
Palais O
de O

a O
very B-OP
unique I-OP
collection B-AS
of I-AS
clothing I-AS

A O
fantastic B-OP

you O
can O
even O
take O
a O

Do O

Surrounded O

just O
wandering B-AS
about O
the O
several O
floors O
of O
all O

hours O
when O
this O
tiny B-OP

is O
technically O
open B-OP
to I-OP
the I-OP

, O
but O
the O
more O
daring O

our O
beerbong O
. O

Just O
for O
that O
, O
this O
park B-AS
is O
awesome B-OP
. O

It O
s O
worth O
it O
to O
visit O
the O
Legion O
of O
Honor O
just O
to O
see O
the O
building O
and O
the O
views O
around O

If O
you O
re O
into O
the O
20 O
s O
scene O
, O
go O
here O
. O

Was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
food O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
little O
more O
hardy O
than O
what O
was O
served O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
found O
ourselves O
smiling B-AS
the O
whole B-OP
night I-OP
long I-OP
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
give O
this O
place O
a O
visit O
today O
, O
because O
the O

looked B-OP
pretty I-OP
fun I-OP
. O

To O
say O
that O
, O
I O
d O
say O
the O
experience B-AS

If O
you O
perhaps O
purchased O
some O
sushi O
to O
go O

this O
is O
a O

a O
good O
place O
to O
get O
quality B-OP

they O
are O
pricey B-OP

I O
would O
probably O
like O
this O
place O
more O
if O
they O
had O
more O
vegetarian O
options O
but O
otherwise O
not O
bad O
. O

The O
bikes B-AS
were O
also O
lovely B-OP

Not B-OP
a I-OP

I O
saw O
Al O

here O
and O
danced O
in O
the O
aisles O
like O
a O
baby O
on O
a O
cruise O

For O
the O
wealthy O
only O

The O
wine B-AS
is O
fantastic B-OP
, O
especially O
the O
sparkling O

it O
can O
get O
cold O

even O
on O
a O
sunny B-OP
day B-AS
with O
all O
that O

blowing O
through O

This O

will O
take B-OP
your I-OP
breath I-OP
away I-OP

They O
go O
out O

The O

I O
knew O
the O

I O
expected O
the O

be O

, O
it O
was O
n't O
. O

My O
best O

I O
cruised B-AS
through O
Golden O

had O
a O

Our O
local O

was O
a O
great O
success O
, O
and O
visiting O
it O
does O
take O
one O

More O
a O

not O
a O
scramble O
to O
get O

on O
the O

Our O
guests O
were O
seated O
for O
20 O
minutes O
before O
they O
were O
greeted O
by O
the O
waiter O
, O
this O
was O
after O
a O
debacle O
of O
having O
our O
table O
set O
for O
10 O
, O
when O
we O
were O
a O
party O
of O

. O

It O
s O
just O
to O
bad O
they O
re O
nominally O
restricted B-OP
to I-OP
kids B-AS
only I-AS
: O
( O

Just O
okay O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
part O
of O

I O
love O

and O
yes O
, O
the O
alcohol O
helped O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
I O
just O
didn O
‚Äô O
t O
really O
find O
anything O
here O
that O
fascinating O
. O

I O
recommend O
going O
outside O
before O
and O
afterwards O
, O
and O
just O
enjoying B-OP
the O
fountain B-AS
. O

The O
crooked B-AS
street I-AS
ride I-AS
was O
colorful B-OP
, O
thrilling B-OP

have O
a O
better O
chance O
of O
getting O
good B-OP

. O

some O
cool B-OP
stuff B-AS
you O

to O
enjoy B-OP
the O
