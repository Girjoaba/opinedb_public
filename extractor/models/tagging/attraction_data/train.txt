be O
honest O

crowded B-AS

There O
is O
a B-OP
lot I-OP
of I-OP
history B-AS

reading I-AS

so O
younger B-AS

may O
get O

if O
your O

, O
grab O

area I-AS
on O
the O
third O
floor O
of O
the O
Crocker O
Galleria O
that O
has O
an O

Whenever O
I O

they O
remember O

make O
me O
feel O
welcome O

The O
Pier B-AS

This O

I O
m O
a O
Bay O

It O
is O
also O
a O
haunting B-OP
place B-AS

Specialty O
is O
fresh B-OP

they O
have O
an O
abundant B-OP

Had O
an O

with O
my O
red O

This O
is O
very O
interesting O
to O
everyone O

and O
it O
makes O
me O
ache O
for O
home O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
even O
though O
I O
am O
in O
a O
pretty O
serious O
relationship O
with O
the O
PNW O

The O
host B-AS
does O
a O
fantastic B-OP
time B-AS
of O
making O
you O
feel O
welcomed B-OP
and O
at O
home O
. O

I O
only O
missed O
one O
exhibit O
, O
but O
it O
looks O
to O
be O
their O
ongoing O
exhibit O
, O
so O
I O
ll O
try O
to O
view O
that O
on O
a O
future O
visit O
. O

It O
was O
getting O
a O
little O
fuller O
when O
we O
left O
shortly O
before O
noon O
but O
spots O
were O
turning O
over O
fairly O
regularly O

makes O
all O
the O
difference O
with O

The O
live B-OP
feedings B-AS
and O
interactions B-AS
with I-AS
the I-AS
animals I-AS
make O
this O
zoo B-AS
spectacular B-OP
to O
me O
. O

and O
it O
s O
by O
a O
nice B-OP
little I-OP
beach B-AS
. O

We O
enjoy O
it O
too O
and O
are O
thrilled O
to O
be O
getting O
our O
kids B-AS
excited B-OP
about I-OP
science I-OP
at O
such O
a O
young O
age O
. O

Worth B-OP
the O
drive/walk B-AS
. O

The O
dramatic B-AS
work I-AS
is O
great B-OP
but O
comedy B-AS
is O
really O
where O
it O
s O
at O
for O
Stage O
Werx O
. O

I O
can O
even O
see O
my O
condo O
from O
here O
... O

It O
s O
worth B-OP
checking I-OP
the O
exhibition B-AS
online O
before O
arriving O
in O
person O
. O

But O
if O
you O
re O
someone O
into O
experiencing O
something O
totally O
unique O
and O
having O
an O
inter-personal B-OP
experience B-AS
with O
a O
live B-OP
performance B-AS
piece O
, O
then O
it O
s O
well-worth O
at O
least O
going O
once O
. O

It O
s O
so O
cool O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
around O
with O
a O
fun B-OP
crowd B-AS
and O
just O
play O
. O

They O
need O
more O
comfy O
furniture O
, O
quieter O
and O
mellower O
more O
coffee O
shop-appropriate O
music O
, O
and O
better O
food O
. O

We O
especially O
love B-OP
the O
members B-AS
only I-AS
hour I-AS
on O
Sunday O
morning O
. O

. O

We O
spent O
the O
last O
holiday O
filming O
a O
short O
video O
for O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
. O

The O
tour O
started O
with O
some O
training O
, O
but O
it O
went O
fast O
and O
the O
segways B-AS
were O
very B-OP
easy I-OP
to I-OP
ride I-OP
. O

It O
was O
definitely O
an O
enjoyable B-OP
zoo B-AS
, O
not B-OP
as I-OP
big I-OP
as O
I O
had O
imagined O
compared O
to O
the O
Oakland B-AS
Zoo I-AS
, O
but O
pretty B-OP
cool I-OP
because O
it O
seemed O
like O
I O
was O
getting O
up O
close B-OP
and I-OP
personal I-OP
with I-OP
the O
animals B-AS
. O

The O
crowds B-AS
can O
be O
pretty B-OP
big I-OP
of O
nice O
days O
so O
prepare O
to O
wait B-AS
for O
a B-OP
long I-OP
time I-OP
if O
you O
want O
to O
use O
a O
port-a-potty O
. O

They O
also O
do O
After O
Dark O
every O
first O
Thursday O
of O
the O

I O
like O
to O
go O
here O
once O
in O
a O
while O
because O
there O
are O
seals O
, O
Ghiradelli O
Factory O
, O
and O
local B-OP
businesses B-AS
. O

the O
exhibits B-AS
are O
very B-OP
interesting I-OP
and I-OP
engaging I-OP
. O

They O
call O
it O
the O
`` O
Beach O
' O
because O
there O
is O
no B-OP
real I-OP
Beach B-AS
to O
hang O
out O
! O
! O

All O
in O
all O
It O
s O
a O
great O
hotel O
but O
if O
any O
of O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
save O
some O
$ O
$ O
then O
book O
it O
at O
SweetHotelDeals O

if O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
WEED B-AS
smells B-OP
, O
go O
there O
- O

Each O
screening O
room O
has O
seats B-AS
really B-OP
crammed I-OP
in O
there O
, O
making O
it O
a O
bit O
uncomfortable O
for O
longer B-OP
shows B-AS
and O
it O
s O
not O
a O
very B-OP
clean I-OP
theater B-AS
either O
. O

Perfect B-OP

be O
interesting B-OP
to O
check O

, O
whenever O

the O
weather B-AS
feels O
different B-OP
inside I-OP
the O

I O
loved O
it O
before O
but O
now O
the O

bumpy O
and O
hard O
to O
navigate O
in O
the O
dark O
all O
have O
new B-OP

amount I-OP
of I-OP

alot O
of O
reason O
to O
come O
back O
for O
several O
months O
for O
even O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

All O
of O
the O
machines B-AS

a B-OP
quarter I-OP
or I-OP
less I-OP
, O
and O
it O
s O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
for I-AS

all O
questions O
. O

Bring O
a O
piece O
of O

This O

a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
for I-AS
a I-AS
meeting I-AS
, O
reading B-AS

catching B-AS
up I-AS
with I-AS
a I-AS

It O
s O
a O
fun B-OP
place B-AS
to O
go O
to O
when O
you O
visit O
SF O

The O
downside B-OP
is O
the O
Lemur B-AS
Cafe I-AS
, O
no B-OP
healthy I-OP
food B-AS
choices I-AS
and O
a O
major B-OP
ripoff B-AS
. O

One O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
after O
your O
rental O
, O
walking O
might O
seem O
a O
bit O
strange O
and O
terribly O
inefficient O
: O
) O

The O
Sutro O

is O
a O
magic B-OP
place B-AS

nice B-AS
day I-AS
at O
the O

from O
random O
people O
. O

Its O
a O
lot O
larger O
than O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
pictures O
. O

The O
setting B-AS
is O
okay B-OP
, O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
things O
do O
not O
do O
it O
justice O
. O

Great B-OP

Amazing O

If O
you O
catch O
it O
on O
a O
sunny O

it O
will O
probably O
be O
the O
best B-OP

enjoy B-OP
the O
good B-AS
life I-AS

Parking O
has O
to O
be O
free O
to O
enjoy O
the O
higher O
prices O
you O
pay O
at O
AMC O
. O

In O
a O
city O
where O
things O
are O
constantly O
changing O
, O
especially O
with O
large O
tech O
companies O
moving O
in O
and O
everyone O
going O
for O
the O
newer O
, O
bigger O
, O
brighter O
, O
flashier O
places O
, O
it O
s O
great O
that O
we O
still O
have O
these O
old O
school O
joints O
that O
show O
local O
, O
foreign O
, O
and O
films O
less O
likely O
to O
make O
the O
big O
screen O
. O

Do O
n't O
bother O
with O
the O
conventional O
theatres O
; O
go O
straight O
for O
the O
21-plus O
( O
note O
: O
it O
will O
need O
to O
state O
as O
much O
on O
your O
ticket O
) O
, O
where O
you O
can O
take O
your O
alcohol O
with O
you O
to O
enjoy O
during O
the O
film O
. O

pretty B-OP
sweet I-OP
museum B-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
could O
get O
any O
better O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
come O
here O
when O
the O
slides O
are O
open O
! O

But O
the O
place O
is O
adequate B-OP
overall B-AS
. O

It O
s O
an O
historical B-OP
experience B-AS
that O
is O
a O
throw-back O
in O
many O
ways O
, O
but O
the O
time-capsule O
element O
is O
part O
of O
what O
makes O
it O
unique O
and O
worth O
checking O
out O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
consider O
that O
this O
guy O
took O
the O
time O
to O
actually O
build O
this O
space O
out O
and O
do O
what O
he O
s O
doing O
here O
, O
in-person O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
very B-OP
friendly I-OP
, O
from O
the O
docents B-AS
to O
the O
security B-AS
guard I-AS
running O
the O
metal O
detector/bag O
screening O
at O
the O
door O
. O

There O
is O
now O
a O
new B-OP
off O
leash B-AS
dog I-AS
area I-AS
after O
they O
closed O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
of O
remodeling O
. O

There O
is O
plenty B-OP
of I-OP
metered B-AS
parking I-AS
in O
front O
, O
but O
it O
should O
only O
be O
25 O
cents/hr O
based O
on O
demand O
. O

My O
review O
is O
a O
little O
late O
, O
we O
actually O
visited O
in O
October O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most B-OP
interesting I-OP
places B-AS
in O
San O
Francisco O
. O

this O
is O
a O
good B-OP
start B-AS
and O
when O
ur O
done O
there O
are O
bars O
all O
over O

Would O
drop O
by O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
a O
show O
again O
. O

ya O
que O
se O
forman O
unas O
colas O
muy O
grandes O
en O
el O
bano O
. O

I O
think O
she O
was O
the O
only O
one O
. O

Three O
great O
reasons O
just O
about O
everyone O
should O
go O
to O
this O
museum O
, O
plus O
a O
little O
more O
: O
1 O
. O
Location O
and O
setting O
, O
perched B-OP
atop I-OP
the O
cliffs B-AS
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
Pacific O
with O
great O
, O
green B-OP
lawns B-AS
-- O
for O
those O
who O
enjoy B-OP
views B-AS
and I-AS
land I-AS
( O
and O
sea O
) O
scapes O
. O

Every O
niche O
holds O
wonder O
, O
here O
. O

The O
lighting B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
, O
and O
the O
acoustics B-AS
are O
great B-OP
. O

Normally O
, O
I O
visit O
during O
the O
day O
, O
but O
the O
past O
couple O
visits O
have O
all O
been O
during O
nightlife O
. O

crookedest B-OP
street B-AS
of O
the O
world O
drive B-AS
or O
walk B-AS
on O
the O
street O
is O
pretty B-OP
interesting I-OP
with O
views B-AS
of B-OP
small I-OP
houses I-OP
around O
one B-OP
of I-OP
a I-OP
kind I-OP
experience B-AS

Bought O
some O
chem O
clean O
. O

What O
I O
most O
like O
about O
it O
is O
that O
its O
a O
typical B-OP
collection B-AS
of I-AS
European I-AS
art I-AS
from O
the O
late O
Gothic O
through O
the O
Impressionists O
, O
and O
it O
s O
not O
enormous O
, O
so O
it O
offers O
a O
manageable-in-one-day O
and O
excellent B-OP
primer B-AS
on I-AS
European I-AS
art I-AS
without O
the O
late O
afternoon O
exhaustion O
or O
fatigue O
. O

Worth B-OP
visiting B-AS
! O

Get O
the O
popcorn O
and O
enjoy B-OP
the O
vintage B-AS
experience I-AS
! O

Great B-OP
views B-AS
and O
a B-OP
lot I-OP
of I-OP
uphill B-AS

They O
have O
all O
the O
basics O
of O
a O
great B-OP
playground B-AS
- O
swings O
, O
sandbox O
, O
and O
play O
structure O
with O
areas O
for B-OP
tiny I-OP
tots I-OP
to I-OP
older I-OP
kids B-AS
. O

I O
got O
popcorn O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
make O
me O
sick O
. O

Bought O
an O
awesome O
mobile O
from O
this O
place O
years O
ago O
. O

If O
you O
would O
like O
to O
get O
a O
good B-OP
picture B-AS
during O
daylight O
take O
it O
from O
the O
San O
Francisco O
Viewing O
side O
and O
at O
night O
take O
it O
from O
the O
opposite O
side O
to O
get O
the O
optimum O
picture O
. O

The O
tower B-AS
is O
closed B-OP

Drinks O
are O
served O
( O
$ O
5 O
beers O

$ O
10 O
cocktails O
and O
like O
$ O
7 O
for O
wine O
or O
something O
like O
that O
) O
. O

It O
s O
totally O
worth B-OP
that O
extra B-AS
long I-AS
trek I-AS
on O
Geary O
or O
up O
the O
Great O
Highway O
. O

but O
I O
prefer B-OP
visiting B-AS
the I-AS
building I-AS
as O
such O
. O

I O
like B-OP
to O
come O
here O
at O
night B-AS
to O
look O
at O
the O
city B-AS
lights I-AS
and O
to O
take O
in O

and O
much O
much O
more O
about O
not O
only O
Yosemite O
, O
but O
all O
of O
California O
. O

But O
other O
than O
that O
, O
25 B-OP
bucks I-OP
for I-OP
an B-AS
all I-AS
day I-AS
ride I-AS
around O
the O

aint O
bad O
at O
all O
. O

there O

some O

We O
arrived O
a O
couple O

the O

Good B-OP
clean I-OP

Given O
the O
relatively B-OP
low I-OP
cost B-AS
of I-AS

, O
your O
visit O
can O
be O
a O
quick B-OP
walk B-AS

Lovely B-OP
theater B-AS

Situated O

wonderful B-OP
part I-OP
of I-OP
the O
park B-AS
, O
with O
a O
fantastic B-OP
dahlia B-AS
garden I-AS
just O
outside O
( O
dahlias B-AS
are O
seasonal B-OP
, O
so O
make O
sure O
you O
see O
them O
in O
bloom O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
regret O
it O
) O
. O

The O
owner B-AS
is O
rude B-OP
, O
nothing O
but O
raggedy B-OP
overpriced I-OP
plants B-AS
and O
inbreeding B-OP
guppies B-AS
. O

Nice B-OP
theatre B-AS
, O
with O
lots B-OP
of I-OP
food B-AS
& I-AS
drink I-AS
options I-AS
in O
and O
around O
it O

The O
surrounding B-AS
makes O
it O
even O
more B-OP
pleasing I-OP
for O
the O
eyes O
. O

This O
is O
the O
OTHER O
San O
Francisco O
Conservatory O
, O
and O
quite B-OP
a I-OP
gem B-AS
it O
is O
. O

One O
caveat O
-- O
some O
of O
the O
subject O
matter O
is O
unsettling O
as O
the O
photographers O
present O
unvarnished O
, O
harsh O
realities O
. O

Probably O
the O
best B-OP
audio B-AS
tour I-AS
I O
ve O
ever O
went O
on O
. O

The O
California O
Academy O
of O
Sciences O
is O
such O
a O
fantastic B-OP
facility B-AS
! O

The O
tour O
took O
us O
through O
many O
of O
the O
streets O
of O
San O
Francisco O
, O
and O
our O
guide O
provided O
constant B-OP
interesting I-OP
information B-AS
as O
we O
went O
. O

Had O
a O
wonderful B-OP
time B-AS
and O
will O
definitely O
be O
going O
back O
! O

We O
enjoyed O
our O
day O
exploring B-OP
the O
museum B-AS
and O
all O
its O
exhibits O
and O
then O
made O
our O
way O
to O
the O
grounds O
to O
explore O
more O
. O

This O
pad B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
for O
the O
catchment O
of O
water O
. O

A O
flight O
to O
Paris O
and O
tickets O
will O
be O
needed O
. O

This O
is O
an O
oddly B-OP
designed I-OP
Century B-AS
Theater I-AS
. O

Hidden B-OP
gem B-AS
in O
SOMA O
! O

The O
living B-AS
roof I-AS
is O
a O
real B-OP
treat I-OP
, O
too O
, O
thanks O
to O
the O
peepholes O
designed O
for O
an O
up-close O
look O
. O

expected B-OP
a I-OP
bigger I-OP
submarine B-AS
. O

It O
s O
an O
excellent B-OP
place B-AS
to I-AS
bring I-AS
your I-AS
kids I-AS
- O
they O
def O
. O

but O
I O
recognize O
that O
speed O
has O
to O
take O
precedence O
over O
quality O
on O
a O
night O
like O
nye O
. O

Nice B-OP
park B-AS
with O
a O
beautiful B-OP
view B-AS
on O
the O
city O
and O
the O
bay O
. O

Because O
the O
old O
fortress O
is O
on O
the O
water O
, O
the O
wind B-AS
can O
be O
very B-OP
strong I-OP
. O

Have O
a O
blast B-OP
with I-OP
family B-AS
fun I-AS
in O
the O
city O
! O

Always O
a O
good B-OP
time B-AS
when O
it O
s O
sunny O
. O

San O
Franciso O
does O
NOT O
tailgate O
. O

Bring O
a O
camera O
and O
water O
, O
and O
wear O
clothes O
you O
can O
sweat O
in O
. O

Hint O
: O
hike O
up O
on O
the O
Castro O
street O
side O
if O
you O
want O
the O
most O
phisically O
challenging O
route O
. O

Love B-OP
the O
hand-painted B-AS
sweatshirts I-AS
and O
graphic O
prints O
from O
local B-OP
artists B-AS

Easy I-OP
Walk I-OP
From I-OP
Coit B-AS
Tower I-AS
. O

I O
could O
eat O
only O
half O
of O
the O
bowl O
but O
was O
still O
thirsty O
all O
day O
. O

This O
is O
not B-OP
a I-OP
very I-OP
touristic I-OP
place B-AS
, O
you O
can O
take O
your O
time O
on O
the O
grass O
to O
read O
a O
book O
. O

The O
best O
part O
is O
being O
able O
to O
take O
the O
segway O
on O
your O
own O
without O
a O
tour O
. O

Great B-OP
theatre B-AS
when O
you O
wan O
na O
get O
away O
from O
the O

and O
the O
teeny O
boppers O

But O
, O
it O
s O
a O
huge B-OP
complex B-AS
, O

early O
and O
get O
some O
good B-OP
food B-AS
right O
inside O
the O
complex O
. O

generally O
pretty O
cold O

One O
of O
the O
older B-OP

The O

on O
the O

all O
a O

too B-OP
similar I-OP
with O
spirituous O

left O
off O

Formal O
looking O
square O
with O

I O

not O
be O
returning O

really O
the O

that O
cool B-OP
new I-OP
rubber B-AS

that O
makes O
it O
almost O
impossible O
for O
the O
tots O
to O
hurt O
themselves O
... O

It O
s O
all O
about O
selling O
what O
s O
right O
for O
the O

not O
trying O

My O

You O
can O
either O
walk O
it O
( O
made O
relatively O
easy O
with O

you O
can O
just O
drive O

N O
also O
the O

The O
parking B-AS
says O
two B-OP
hours I-OP
free I-OP
with O
no O
mention O
of O
parking O
validation O
but O
that O
s O
bullshit O
. O

I O
would O
highly B-OP
recommend I-OP
going B-AS
to O
Academy O
of O
Science O
After O
Dark O
over O
the O
Exploratorium O
. O

Even O
if O
it O
s O

of I-OP
fun B-AS
at O
Ripley O

if O
one O
knows O
what O
he/she O
is O
looking O

Unfortunately O
they O
always O
seem O
to O
crank O
up O
the O
heater O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
temperature O
is O
outside O
. O

There O
are O
incredible B-OP
views B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
city I-AS
if O
you O
sit O
far O
enough O
up O
the O
hill O

There O
are O
many O
different O
parts O
of O
park B-AS
you O
can B-OP
explore I-OP
and I-OP
enjoy I-OP
. O

The O
Pier O
is O
always B-OP
packed I-OP
with I-OP
people B-AS
from O
all O
over O
the O

it O
is O

I O
would O
say O
, O
I O
like O
all O
of O
the O

We O
parents O
can O
kick O
back O

know O
that O
our O

are O
safe B-OP
without O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
them O
running O
off O
somewhere O
or O
getting O
hurt O
too O
badly O
. O

Not O
so O
big O
that O
you O
get O
lost O
in O
the O
crowd O
but O
enough O
room O
to O
have O
an O
conversation O
. O

Until O
spring O
2014 O
under O
construction O
, O
no O
access O
to O

Too O

for O
the O

This O

informative B-OP
& O
funny B-OP
& O
the O
training B-AS
was O
useful B-OP

lighthearted I-OP
also O
... O

Since O

, O
I O
ve O
come O
here O
on O

interesting B-OP
place B-AS

visit I-AS
. O

and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
playgrounds B-AS
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
came O
in O
to O
view O
an O
Allen O
Ginsberg O
exhibit O
so O
admittedly O
I O
spent O
more O
time O
looking O
at O
that O
collection O
than O
anything O
else O
. O

The O
while O
place B-AS
is O
really B-OP
crammed I-OP
and O
not B-OP
too I-OP
clean I-OP
. O

the O
artists B-AS
are O
very B-OP
talented I-OP
and O
their O
works B-AS
are O
cool B-OP
to O
look O
at O

Go O
see O
the O
sealions O
here O

Day B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
overcast B-OP
and O
chilly B-OP
but O
having O

delicious B-OP
food B-AS

The O

( O
a O

only O
12 O
in O
the O
world O
, O
I O
believe O
) O
, O
sits O
at O
the O
entrance O
. O

A O
fun B-OP
, O
inexpensive B-OP
way O
to O
have O
a O
great B-OP
day B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
waterfront I-AS
. O

The O
new O
location B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
. O

what O
a O
fun B-OP
place B-AS
to I-AS
hang I-AS
out I-AS
on O
a O
clear O
day O
or O
to O
shelter O
behind O
the O
rock O
ramparts O
and O
watch O
the O
fog O
roll O
in O
. O

Sometimes O
not B-OP
a I-OP
lot I-OP
of I-OP
staffs B-AS
work O
there O

Our O
first O
destination O
, O
Oxford B-AS
Winery I-AS
was O
absolutely B-OP
spectacular I-OP
, O
very B-OP
interesting I-OP
and I-OP
informative I-OP
. O

I O
often O
stop O
by O
here O
to O
just O
relax B-AS
and I-AS
breath I-AS
in B-OP
the I-OP
bay I-OP
air I-OP
. O

Just O
one O
thing O
though O
, O
these O
bikes B-AS
are O
extremely B-OP
heavy I-OP
and O
we O
had O
to O
carry O
or O
drag O
them O
down O
stairs O
and O
my O
gf O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
with O
that O
. O

Sometimes O
they O
burn O
the O
popcorn O
a O
little O
bit O
and O
the O
ambiance B-AS
can O
be O
smoky B-OP
as O
a O
result O
but O
then O
who O
does O
n't O
transgress O
similarly O
from O
time O
to O
time O
? O

The O
food B-AS
is O
wonderful B-OP
and O
always B-OP
top I-OP
quality I-OP
. O

I O
ate O
the O
rainbow B-AS
trout I-AS
, O
charcoal O
grilled O
, O
and O
it O
was O
terrible B-OP
. O

The O
complimentary B-OP
breakfast B-AS
is O
simple O
, O
with O
fresh B-OP
bagels B-AS
, I-AS
juice I-AS
and I-AS
coffee I-AS
. O

people B-AS
to O

make O
friends O
with O
. O

I O
love B-OP
this O
museum B-AS
. O

but O
anyway O
this O
is O
the O
one O
you O
should O
go O
to O
when O
you O
come O
in O
San O
Francisco O
. O

The O
gallery O
usually O
carries O
a B-OP
large I-OP
collection I-OP
of I-OP
prints B-AS
from O
these O
shows O
and O
features O
a O
great B-OP
online B-AS
store I-AS
for O
people O
out-of-state O
to O
order O
from O
. O

The O
sort O
of O
place O
where O
you O
take O
pretty B-OP
family B-AS
pictures I-AS
. O

We O
went O
across O
and O
took O
the O
bunker O
road O
to O
several O
great B-OP
overlooks B-AS
. O

I O
ve O
had O
a O
similar O
dish O
from O
the O
frozen O
food O
section O
at O
the O
grocery O
store O
. O

sometimes O
artwork B-AS
is O

and O
the O
place O
is O
great B-OP
for I-OP
leisure B-AS
time I-AS

great B-OP
sourdough B-AS
bread I-AS
, O
but O
this O
San O

institution O
no O
longer O
has O
the O
quality O
it O
once O
had O

The O
people B-AS
are O
genuine B-OP
, O
friendly B-OP
, O
and O
really B-OP
passionate I-OP
about O
wine O
. O

Its O
one O
of O
the O
top B-OP
attractions B-AS
in O
the O
city O

No B-OP
bad I-OP
seats B-AS
in O
the O
ballpark O
. O

I O
rate O
this O
museum B-AS
poor B-OP
due O
to O
the O
cost B-AS
of I-AS
admission I-AS
. O

This O
mid-century B-OP
modern I-OP
building B-AS
mix B-OP
of I-OP
elegance B-AS
and I-AS
stolid I-AS
architecural I-AS
power I-AS
. O

There O
are O
a O
bunch B-OP
of I-OP

less B-OP
crowded I-OP
though O
. O

you O
can O
relax O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
round O
former O
tank O
emplacement O
and O
visualize O
yourself O
being O
evacuated O
by O

from O
the O

of O
SF O

They O
make O
their O
popcorn O
fresh O
before O

were O
boring B-OP
. O

It O
s O
not O
just O
the O
function O
and O
purpose O
of O
the O

but O
the O
meaning O
and O

of O
what O

just O
that O

If O

the O

the O

and O
the O

by O
gradually O
improving B-OP
the O

It O

great B-OP
spot B-AS
for I-AS
a I-AS

or O
a O
small B-AS
group I-AS
of I-AS
friends I-AS

Their O
rotating O

mean O
there O
is O
always B-OP
something I-OP
new B-AS
to I-AS
see I-AS
and O
they O
often O
bring O
in O
artists B-AS

However O
when O
you O

My O
favorite B-OP
place B-AS
in O
San O
Francisco O
to O
see O
a O
movie O
! O

It O
set O
the O

of O
our O

( O
We O
drove O
from O

this O

for O
it O

My O
favorite B-OP
part O
is O
the O
rainforest B-AS
. O

Staff B-AS
looked B-OP
tired I-OP
and I-OP
hungry I-OP
. O

The O
animals O
were O
cool O
but O
the O
place B-AS
is O
poorly B-OP
managed I-OP
and O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
lack B-OP
of I-OP
ideas B-AS
as O
to O
how O
to O
run O
a O
fun B-OP
zoo B-AS
. O

Seriously O
, O
they O
ve O
done O
an O
excellent O
job O
with O
their O
aquatic B-OP
husbandry B-AS
( O
you O
wo O
n't O
believe O
the O
size O
of O
their O
squamosa O
! O
) O
as O
well O
as O
the O
astounding B-OP
indoor B-AS

Motown O

use O
the O
restroom O

The O
adjoining O
art O
gallery O
space O
is O
a O
nice B-OP
quiet I-OP
spot B-AS
but O
needs O
shades O
on O
the O
windows O
to O
prevent O
it O
from O
getting O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
afternoon O
and O
needs O

P.S O

I O
thought O
watching O
the O
special O
cow O
eye O

would O
wake O
me O
up O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
it O
was O
still O
kind B-OP
of I-OP
a O
snooze B-AS
fest I-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
was O
very B-OP
knowledgable I-OP
about O
the O
wines O
, O
and O
they O
were O
very B-OP
accomodating I-OP
, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
great B-OP
afternoon B-AS
! O

I O
love B-OP
the O
aquarium B-AS
. O

The O
side O
dish O
was O
some O
kind O
of O
wilted O
dandelion O
glop O
, O
it O
tasted O
like O
the O
underside O
of O
a O
lawn O
mower O
, O
and O
even O
though O
the O
ingredients B-AS
were O
supposedly B-OP
very I-OP
expensive I-OP
, O
the O
flavor B-AS
was O
not B-OP
good I-OP
, O
almost O
as O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
too O
hard O
with O
great O
ingredients O
to O
achieve O
mediocre O
success O
. O

Great O
. O

Except O
the O
elderly O
. O

I O
always O
heard O
about O
Lands O
End O
and O
Sutro O

but O
they O
seemed O
to O
far O
away O
. O

Came B-AS
here O
with B-OP
a I-OP
friend I-OP
before O
catching O
a O
show O
at O

is O
excellent B-OP
, O
lots B-OP
of I-OP
leg B-AS
